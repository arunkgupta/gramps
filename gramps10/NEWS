Version 0.8.0
* Addiition of ZODB support. Support is still preliminary, and not
  as feature full as the XML support. Requires python 2.1 or higher,
  so not a good solution for RedHat users, unless the which to compile
  the python and python-gnome libraries. (RH7.3 ships with python2.2,
  but that version is tied to an early beta of the GNOME 2 libraries)
* New build structure from David Hampton.
* Significant improvement in speed with the GEDCOM export.
* Enhanced web page generation.
* Fixed Mandrake 8.2/imlib problem the could cause GRAMPS to fail to
  run under Mandrake 8.2.

  filters that can be applied to reports to select the people that
  you want. Tools->Utilites->Custom Filter Editor to access the
  filter builder. (Thanks to Jeff Ollie for some major contributions 
  here).
* New report - Complete Individual Report. Allows you to produce a
  more complete form of the Individual Summary. You can use filters
  to select all ancestors, all decendants, or any custom filter you
  want to create more of a 'book' form of a report.
* On-the-fly document generation instead of pre-built HTML files
  (Thanks to Don Peterson)
* Web page generation now generates a two column list, along with
  labels.
* GEDCOM impovements, including the ability to use GRAMPS as a GEDCOM
  viewer (accepts a GEDCOM file as an argument).


Version 0.7.2
* New Brazilian-Portuguese translation (Marcos Bedinelli)
* Python Imaging Library no longer required for several report
  formats.
* Better sizing of images in reports (Bruce DeGrasse)
* An image subdirectory name can now be specified in the WebPage
  generation. This allows you to specify the subdirectory (or
  absence of a subdirectory) where images are placed when generating
  a web site.
* Merging allows you to choose the GRAMPS ID of the merged person.
* Better handling of auto completion of names, places, and other

Version 0.7.0
* LD_PRELOAD set to handle Mandrake 8.1 shared library problems.
* Drag and drop copying of events, address, attributes, and URLs.
* Improved GEDCOM. GRAMPS now understands many more of the "quirks"
  of the GEDCOM produced by other programs. In addition, GRAMPS can
  now tailor its GEDCOM output several other programs. An XML data
  file is used to describe to GRAMPS the types of quirks each 
  format uses.
* Support for French Republican, Hebrew, and Julian calendars.
* LDS ordinance support.
* Cleaned up report dialog code.

* Adoption relationships are visible on the pedigree view (seen as
  a dotted line).
* Reordering GRAMPS' ids attempts to preserve the integer originally
  assigned to the object.
* The person view can be sorted by GRAMPS id.

* Support for RTF (export to MSWord) and limited support for KWord
  and LaTeX added.
* User defined styles for reports. Allows the selection of fonts,
  sizes, colors, alignment, and many other features in output 
  reports. Styles can be saved for future use.
* Improved report formats
* Initial German translation. Please note that the German translation 
  is new, and it will take a while before it is fully in sync with the
  program. It will probably take a release or two before it is as 
  stable as the Swedish translation (it can take a while to provide the
  translations, and the code is changing, so it takes a while to flush
  things out).
* Output format preference and page size preference can be set in the
  preferences menu.
* Names can now have sources and notes.
* Lots of bug fixes
* Fixes to GEDCOM importer

Version 0.2.0
* New GEDCOM importer. This new importer understands the GEDCOM
  file structure, and intelligently parses the file.  More 
  information is extracted from the GEDCOM file. Guessing the 
  context of information is no longer done, so the data should go 
  into the right place.  The display dialog now displays useful and 
  interesting information as the file is loaded.  The importer
  has been checked with file generated Personal Ancestral File,
  Brother's Keeper, DISGEN, the GEDCOM Torture test, and even the
  sometimes strange output of Family Tree Maker.
* Better support for sources.  Source button on the main page, and
  sources are entered from the main screen, instead of being about 
  five layers deep.
* Events, sources, attributes, and addresses can now have both 
  sources and notes.
* Limited configurability in status bar display. Instead of just a
  name, you can have a name, the internal ID and a name, or a user
  selectable attribute and a name.
* A user selectable attribute can be displayed on the Edit Person
  display along with the gramps internal ID.  The attribute is
  specified in the preferences settings, and the value is taken
  from the person's attribute list.
* Images now load faster. Thumbnail images are created and maintained
  by gramps, eliminating the need to rescale images everytime a 
  gallery is displayed.
* Paper size preference can now be specified in the preferences 
  dialog. Once this is set, gramps will make this the default for
  report generators. Eventually, you will be able to do the same
  for output format preference. This button is current disabled.
* Generating slightly better XML. Maintaining compatibility with
  the older files.


Version 0.1.5

* Plenty of bug fixes in the report generators and merging due to the
  previous addition of date ranges.
* Added PDF file type generation for reports. Depends on the reportlab
  package (available at www.reportlab.com).  If the package is not
  installed, gramps will run, but without PDF generation ability.
* Will use the Python Imaging Library if present to handle images.  If
  not, it will revert to the old method of using Imagick (convert).
* The user can select an attribute (from the attribute list) to display
  on the Edit Person window.
* The internal gramps ID is now displayed on the Edit Person window.
* Marriage types can now be recorded.
* Addresses now use a single date instead of multiple dates, since 
  dates can now deal with ranges.
* Due to a bug in Python 2.0/GTK interaction, list colors are disabled
  for Python 2.0 and above.
* configure script now properly deals with Python include paths,
  eliminating the need to hand edit the src/Makefile to get gramps to
  run under Python 2.X.
* Photos are now displayed properly again in the Edit Person gallery.
* Family notes are now implemented.

Version 0.1.4

* Implemented date ranges.  Valid forms are "from <date> to <date>" and
  "between <date> and <date>".
* Better support for partial dates.  A question mark can optionally be 
  used for a placeholder for a year if the year is unknown.  Illegal 
  date formats issue a warning upon an attempt to save the date.
* Start of internationalization (i18n) support.  Had to include a single
  C file to allow libglade to understand translations.  This means that
  binary releases are no longer going to be platform independant.
* Start of a generic output formatter for report generation. Currently
  supports HTML, OpenOffice (625+), and AbiWord (0.7.13+).  Allows 
  control of paragraph and font styles.
* Added into CVS on sourceforge
* Fixed quite a few bugs

Version 0.1.3

* Allow the user to specifiy their preferred numerical date input format,
  either DD/MM/YY or MM/DD/YY on the preferences dialog box.
* Handles file problems a bit more gracefully.
* Use ISO-8859-1 character set instead of ASCII to support languages other
  than English.  Eventually this should go to unicode, but python 1.5.2
  does not have good unicode support.  Python 2.X/Gnome 2.X will be the 
  migration for this feature.
* Handle ANSEL encoding for import and exporting GEDCOM files.
* Fixed a bug in the selection of parents, which did not accept new parents
  if previous parents did not exist.

Version 0.1.2

* Allow the user the option to display alternate names in the person
  list. Alternate names in the list have an '*' appended to the end
  of the name.
* Merge function now gives the user the option of saving the name of
  the merged individual as an alternate name if the names are not 
  the same.
* Added the "Alternate Birth" and "Alternate Death" to the event list, 
  to allow other birthdates to be recorded. Gramps makes a distinction
  between the birthdate/deathdate and the alternates.
* GEDCOM import and export adapted to load/save alternate birth and
  death dates.  The first "BIRT" and "DEAT" tags are the ones used
  for the primary dates, the others are loaded as alternates.
* Added the ability to store web page addresses for each person. From
  the edit person page, the "Go" button brings up a web browser to
  display the page.
* Fixed a bug in the relationship calculator that caused a traceback
  when the person selected was a direct ancestor of the active person.
* Added the suffix field to the alternate name entry on the Edit Person
  form.
