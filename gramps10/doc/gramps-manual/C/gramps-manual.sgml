    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
    <application>GRAMPS</application> is an acronym for the
    Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Programming System.
    It was conceived under the concept that most genealogy programs
    were designed to provide the researcher the capability to input
    information related to a particular family tree.  Most of these
    programs have allowed for the arranging and storing of information
    consistent with the GEDCOM standards.  They usually provide a
    means for displaying descendant or ancestral relationships by
    means of graphical displays, charts, or reports.  These may be
    augmented with pictures or other media to enhance the data.  Most
    provide for inputting data on unconnected individuals/families
    that may or may not have a relationship to the primary surname
    being researched.  Various other enhancements may also be provided
    in the genealogical program that allows for different degrees of
    importing and exporting data from other programs and printing of
    the data contained in the various reports.  GRAMPS, on the other
    hand, attempts to provide all of the common capabilities of these
    programs, but, more importantly, to provide a capability not
    common to these programs.  This is the ability to input any bits
    and pieces of information directly into GRAMPS and
    rearrange/manipulate any/all data events in the entire data base
    (in any order or sequence) to assist the user in doing research,
    analysis and correlation with the potential of filling
    relationship gaps.  In short, a tool that provides a way to input
    all your research into one place and do your analysis and
    correlation using the speed, power, and accuracy of your computer
    instead of pencils and unmanageable reams of paper.

    <sect2 id="seleditindv">
      <title>Selecting and Editing Individuals</title>
      <para>
      The People View lists the individuals in the database. An
      individual can be selected as the active person by clicking on
      an entry in the list. Once a person has been selected as the
      active person, the person's name appears in the status bar in
      the lower left hand corner of the window.
      </para>
      <para>
      Once the active person has been selected, pressing the
      <guibutton>Edit Person</guibutton> button will display the
      <interface>Edit Person</interface> dialog allowing you to edit
      the individual's personal information.  If the <guibutton>Edit
      Person</guibutton> button is pressed without an active person
      being set, a blank <interface>Edit Person</interface> dialog is
      presented, allowing you to enter a new person.
      </para>
      <para>
      Double-clicking on a entry in the list will set the active
      person and bring up the individual in the <interface>Edit
      Person</interface> dialog.
      </para>
      <para>
      Pressing the <guibutton>Add Person</guibutton> button will
      display a blank <interface>Edit Person</interface> dialog,
      allowing you to add a new person to the database.

      <para>
      If the <guibutton>Delete Person</guibutton> button is pressed,
      the active person and all of the personal information related to
      the active person are removed from the database.

    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Applying Filters</title>
      <para>
      <application>GRAMPS</application> allows you to apply filters to
      the People View. When a filter is applied, the People View will
      only display the entries matching the filter. All of the entries
      remain in the database, but some entries may be temporarily hidden.
      </para>
      <para>
      There are up to three parts to a filter. The first part is the
      selection of the filter to be applied. A filter is selected from
      the option menu directly above the People View. The second part
      is an optional argument. This qualifier provides more specific
      information for the filter. Many filters do not require the
      argument, and it will not be displayed if it is not needed. If
      the argument is required, a text box with a descriptive label
      will appear.  The third part of the filter is the invert
      selection.  When this option is selected,
      <application>GRAMPS</application> will display the entries that
      do not match the filter.

      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
     <title>Sorting</title>
      <para>
      Four columns are shown in the People View display. The entries
      in the list can be sorted by three of the fields: Name, Birth
      Date, or Death Date.  Clicking on the column label will cause
      the list to be re-sorted by that column.  Arrows on the label
      indicate whether the list is sorted by ascending or descending
      order.
      </para>
      <para>
      If the list is already sorted by a particular column, clicking
      on the same column label will switch the sorting order.  For
      example, if the list is currently sorted in ascending order by
      Name, clicking on the Name column header will re-sort the list
      in descending order.

      The <interface>Gallery</interface> tab allows you to associate
      files (known in <application>GRAMPS</application> as media
      objects) with a particular person. These files are typically
      images or photographs, but may be of any file type, such as (but

      <para>
      <application>GRAMPS</application> provides a central repository
      for all media objects in the Media View. This allows the same
      media object to appear in multiple galleries.  Adding a media
      object to a gallery actually adds the object to the Media View,
      and makes a local reference in the gallery. 
      </para>
      <para>
      While each media object can have a note and attributes attached
      to it, each gallery can add its own notes and attributes to the
      reference in its gallery. This allows media objects to have
      global and local properties. For example, a photo of a family
      reunion may have many people in it. A global note may describe
      the picture in general, identifying the place and date.  When
      this object is added to a gallery, you can attach a note to the
      reference in the gallery adding some specific information, such
      as &quot;Aunt Martha is the third person from the right in the
      second row&quot;. Clicking the <guibutton>Edit
      Properties</guibutton> allows you to edit the local properties.

      The first object in the gallery is considered to be the primary
      image. If this object is an image, it will appear on the
      <interface>General Information</interface> tab, and will be the
      primary image used by report generators. An image can be made
      the default at any time by selecting the thumbnail image and
      dragging it to the first position in the gallery. In this same
      manner, the order of the images can be changed using the same
      drag and drop technique.
      </para>
      <para>
      Objects may be added to the gallery in several ways. By clicking
      the <guibutton>Add Media Object</guibutton> button, a dialog box
      is presented which allows you to choose an object from the file
      system.  This method adds a new object to the Media View and
      creates a reference in the gallery.  Objects may also be added
      by either dragging and dropping from one gallery to another, or
      by dragging from the Media View to a gallery. In this case, a
      new media object is not created, but a reference to an existing
      media object is made in the gallery, sharing the same media
      object between galleries. Finally, new objects may be added to a
      gallery and the Media View by dragging and dropping from a file
      manager (such as <application>Nautilus</application> or
      <application>Konqueror</application>) or a web browser (such as
      <application>Galeon</application>,
      <application>Mozilla</application>, or
      <application>Konqueror</application>) into a gallery.
      </para>
      <para>
      Media objects can be removed from a gallery by clicking the
      <guibutton>Delete Media Object</guibutton> button. This action
      only removes the reference to the current gallery. It does not
      remove the media object from the Media View or from any other
      galleries that are referencing it.

      file is an image, the image will be displayed. Otherwise, an
      icon representing the file type will be displayed. In the dialog

      reference to it in any gallery. You may place the object in as
      many galleries as you like, and only one copy of the file will
      exist.
      </para>
      <para>
      To make a reference to a media object in a gallery, you may
      simply drag-and-drop the object from the Media View directly to
      a gallery. The object will then appear in the
      gallery. Similarly, you may drag-and-drop from one gallery to
      another gallery, and a new object reference is created in the
      target gallery.

      <title>Changing a Media Object's Properties</title>
      <para>
      Media objects have global and local properties. The title of the
      object is a global property. It may only be changed from the
      Media View, and it will affect all references. An object also
      has a global note and a set of user defined global attributes.
      A reference in a gallery may a have a local note and local
      attributes as well. All references share the global properties,
      but each gallery has its own set of notes a attributes.
      </para>
      <para>
      The global note can be used to provide a general
      description. For example, in a family reunion image, you may
      wish to use the global note to indicate the place, date, and
      occasion of the photograph. In a local note in Aunt Martha's
      gallery, you may wish to add a local note indicating that
      &quot;Aunt Martha is the third person from the right in the
      second row&quot;.
      </para>
      <para>
      The global properties may be changed by selecting the
      <guibutton>Edit Media Object</guibutton> button.

    Revision control allows you to keep a history of the changes that
    you have made to your database. Instead of needing to keep
    multiple sets of back up files, a single revision control database
    is maintained. At any point, you can revert back to a previously
    saved version.

    Revision control is enabled in the Revision Control tab of the
    preferences dialog. Once enabled, every save is logged into the

    you to provide a comment about the changes you have made.

    <para>
    <application>GRAMPS</application> can produce a wide variety of
    reports. A new report generator can be written by the user without
    modifying the main program. For this reason, there may be more
    reports available than are documented by this manual.

    </figure>
    <para>
    Unlike many genealogy programs, <application>GRAMPS</application>
    does not directly print reports. Instead,
    <application>GRAMPS</application> produces reports in formats that
    are understood by other programs.  These formats include
    OpenOffice, AbiWord, PDF, and HTML, among others. This allows the
    generated reports to be modified after they are generated, stored
    for use at a later time, or e-mailed to another person.
    </para>
    <para>
    After selecting the report you would like generated there are
    options you must select.  In the Save As option specify your file
    name (use /full path/filename to specify a different directory
    than in your Default Report Directory preference in the
    preferences).  The next step is to select the Report Format.
    After choosing the Format you can select the style you would like
    to use for your report (this does not apply to the HTML format).
    You can Add/Edit/Delete a style for that particular report by
    clicking the <guibutton>Style Editor</guibutton> button.
    Selecting one of those options you can then change the font (font
    face, size, color, and options) for each Paragraph Style along
    with the Paragraph Options (Alignment, background color, margins,
    and borders).  Once you are satisfied with the style you are ready
    to proceed with the generation of your report.  The next step is
    to choose the options (if any for that specific report) and then
    Choose the Template (for HTML format only) and click OK.  Your
    report will now be in default report directory (unless otherwise
    specified). 
    </para>
    <sect2 id="htmltemplates">
      <title>Using HTML templates</title>
      <para>
      Many programs exist to convert GEDCOM files into HTML files that
      can be viewed in a web browser. Most of these programs generate
      HTML files according to their own predefined style. Since most
      people have a style that they prefer, they are left with the
      option of modifying hundreds of files by hand.
      </para>
      <para>
      To solve this problem, <application>GRAMPS</application> allows
      the user to specify a template to be used for generating HTML
      files.  At the time the report is generated, if HTML is selected
      as the target format, the user can select an HTML template to be
      used.  Since the template is chosen at report generation time, a
      different template may be chosen each time, allowing the user to
      change the appearance of the generated files at any time.
      Nearly any existing HTML file can be used as an HTML template
      for <application>GRAMPS</application>.
      </para>
      <para>
      When a file has been established as the HTML template file,
      <application>GRAMPS</application> uses the template for each
      file that it generates. <application>GRAMPS</application> starts
      each file by copying data from the template until it reaches the
      HTML comment, which it uses as a marker.  At that point,
      <application>GRAMPS</application> inserts its data into the
      output file. <application>GRAMPS</application> the continues
      reading the until it reaches a second comment that tells it to
      resume copying from the template.
      </para>
      <para>
      <application>GRAMPS</application> uses the string
      <function>&lt;!-- START --&gt;</function> to indicate where it
      should start inserting its information, and the string
      <function>&lt;!-- STOP --&gt;</function> to indicate where it
      should resume copying data from the template.  The effect is
      that <application>GRAMPS</application> will create a new
      document, replacing everything between the <function>&lt;!--
      START --&gt;</function> and <function>&lt;!-- STOP
      --&gt;</function> comments with the report information.
      </para>
      <para>
      The comment markers should be at the beginning of a line in the
      HTML template file.  Adding the comments to an existing HTML
      document will not affect the original HTML document in any way.
      </para>
      <para>
      If no HTML template is specified, or if the specified template
      cannot be read, <application>GRAMPS</application> will use a
      default, predefined template.
      </para>
      <figure id="templateexample">
        <title>Sample HTML Template Example</title>
        <programlisting>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;
This is my Title
&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
This is a simple template.  This text will appear in the HTML output.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;!-- START --&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
This is where GRAMPS will place its report information. Any 
information between the two comments, including this paragraph,
will not appear in the GRAMPS generated output.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;!-- STOP --&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
This text, since it appears after the stop comment, will also
appear in every GRAMPS generated file.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
