.br 
Currently \fBgramps\fR does not require any command line arguments.
However, if provided, it is the path to either a gramps database or a GEDCOM
file to be imported.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
Gramps is an open source genealogy program. It is written in Python, using the GTK/GNOME interface.
.br 
Gramps should seem familiar to anyone who has used other geneology programs before such as \fIFamily Tree Maker for Windows(TM)\fR or the GNU Geneweb.
.br 
It supports importing of the ever popular GEDCOM format which is used world wide by almost all other geneology software.
.SH "Concepts"
Supports a python\-based plugin system, allowing import and export writers, report generators, tools, and display filters to be added without modification of the main program.
.LP 
Data is stored in an gzip'ed XML format
.LP 
Instead of generating direct printer output, report generators target other systems, such as \fIOpen Office\fR, \fIAbiWord\fR, HTML or LaTeX to allow the user to modify the format to suit his or her needs.
