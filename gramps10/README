Please read the COPYING file first.
If building from source, also read the HACKING file (at least through the
"SUPER-SHORT VERSION") before going further.

Requirements
--------------------------------
Python 1.5.2 or greater
Gnome 1.2 or greater
PyGnome 1.0.53 or greater

If you are using python 1.5.2, you may also need PyXML 0.6.2 or
greater. Many distributions already provide this, but if your
installation does not have it, you can get it from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6473

Documentation
---------------------------------
Gramps documentation is supplied in the form of SGML files, which will be
installed in the GNOME help path(*).  Recent versions of Nautilus and Galeon
can generate HTML on-the-fly documents from these.  For more information on
building HTML files (including info about packages that do and do not work
with the documentation) see the INSTALL file.  To generate HTML
documentation the following packages *MUST* installed:
* db2html >= 0.6.9  (jw >= 1.1)  to convert the SGML -> HTML
* gnome-doc-tools-2-1            for the GNOME documentation style sheets
The former is part of the docbook-utils package, the latter can be found
from the developer section at gnome.org. (note that docbook-utils 0.6.10 is
buggy)

One also needs png support for sgml, which should be a part of the
gnome-doc-tools package. The /etc/sgml/catalog file should
contain an entry pointing to PNG support. If configured properly, your
db2html should automatically look up and use the /etc/sgml/catalog file.

Of course, current HTML documentation can also be found on the gramps website,
http://gramps.sourceforge.net/help.html

(*) More precisely, they are installed in ${prefix}/share/gnome/help, where
${prefix} is given by the --prefix= option to configure.  If this is
different from where your standard GNOME installation looks for help files
and documentation, then set your GNOMEDIR environment variable to the
${prefix} path before starting gramps. For example, if you are installing
gramps in /usr/local/, then type the following:
in tcsh: setenv GNOMEDIR /usr/local/
in bash: GNOMEDIR=/usr/local/ ; export GNOMEDIR


Building on non-Linux systems: i18n support and GNU make
--------------------------------------------------------

Linux has libintl (GNU gettext) built-in the C library. Other systems
are likely to have libintl as a separate or optional library. Also,
other systems may have a different make utility.

On those systems, like FreeBSD, you must tell configure where to find
the libintl library and the libintl.h include file:

CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

Once you have done this, if make fails, use gmake (the name FreeBSD
gives to GNU make) instead.
