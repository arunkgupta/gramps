The following packages are *STRONGLY RECOMMENDED* to be installed:
   osmgpsmap        Used to show maps in the geography view. 
                    Without this the GeoView will not be active, see
                    http://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gramps_3.3_Wiki_Manual_-_Main_Window#Geography_Category
                    The package is named osmgpsmap, osm-gps-map
                    or python-osmgpsmap. Or obtain it from: http://nzjrs.github.com/osm-gps-map/

   GraphViz         Enable creation of graphs using GraphViz engine.
                    Without this no beautiful graphs can be created.
                    Obtain it from: http://www.graphviz.org

   pyexiv2          Enables Gramps to manage Exif metadata embedded in your
                    media. Gramps needs version 0.1.3 or greater.
                    Obtain it from: http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/download.html

  exiv2-devel      Works with pyexiv2, it can be downloaded from here:
                   http://www.exiv2.org/
  python-imaging   Works with pyexiv2.  Allows the copying and converting of image types that python-imaging
                   supports.  Can be downloaded from here:
                   http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

The following packages are optional
   python gtkspell  Enable spell checking in the notes, gtkspell contains the
                    libraries.

   ttf-freefont     More font support in the reports

   PyWebKitGtk or python-gtkmozembed: 
                    The hidden view 'Htmlview' allows websites to be opened in
                    Gramps. Users can unhide the view in the plugin manager. 
                    A html renderer must be installed to use the view.
                    !! PACKAGERS, Test if on your distribution
                    webkit and Gramps is stable. If you obtain crashes, patch 
                    src/plugins/view/htmlrenderer.py and
                    src/plugins/view/geoview.gpr.py, so as to remove:
                       import webkit
                    Then use the gecko package (python-gtkmozembed) instead.
                    If WEBKIT ang GECKO are installed, webkit will be used as
                    the javascript engine is faster (google maps).
                  * PyWebKitGtk    
                    Enable html rendering for the Web view. Often called 
                    python-webkit package. Be careful, webkit is always in a 
                    development phase.
                  * python-gtkmozembed 
                    Enable html rendering for the Web view in case PyWebKitGtk
                    is not available or to be used if webkit is unstable.
                    It can be in python-gnome2-extras or python-gtkhtml2
                    depending on distributions.

Documentation
---------------------------------
The User Manual is now maintained on the gramps website,
http://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=User_manual
We might in the future distribute again a manual via gnome-doc-utils, this has not
been decided yet though.


Building on non-Linux systems: i18n support and GNU make
--------------------------------------------------------
If make fails, use gmake (the name FreeBSD gives to GNU make) instead.
You might need a patch also. FreeBSD has in ports a patch (  /usr/ports/science/gramps/files)
you need to apply to po/Makefile.in.in
