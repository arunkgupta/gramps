                    with xx your language code eg for Dutch you need
                    language-pack-gnome-nl. The translation of the

The following packages are *STRONGLY RECOMMENDED* to be installed:
   pyexiv2-0.1.3    Enables Exif metadata for use with "Image Metadata"
     or greater         and "Edit Image Exif Metadata"
                        http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/download.html  

   GraphViz         Enable creation of graphs using GraphViz engine
                    http://www.graphviz.org

   osmgpsmap        Used to show maps in the geography view.
                    The package is named osmgpsmap or osm-gps-map
                    http://nzjrs.github.com/osm-gps-map/

The following packages are *STRONGLY RECOMMENDED* to be installed if you want
to use the htmlview. The geography view doesn't use them any more :
   PyWebKitGtk or python-gtkmozembed: PACKAGERS, Test if on your distribution
                    webkit and Gramps is stable. If you get crashes, patch 
                    src/plugins/view/htmlrenderer.py and
                    src/plugins/view/geoview.gpr.py, so as to remove:
                       import webkit
                    Then use the gecko package (python-gtkmozembed) instead.
                    If WEBKIT ang GECKO are installed, webkit will be used as
                    the javascript engine is faster (google maps).
   * PyWebKitGtk    
             Enable html rendering for Geographic view and Web view
             Often called python-webkit package.
             Be careful, webkit is always in a development phase.

   * python-gtkmozembed 
             Enable html rendering for Geographic view and Web view
             The gecko (firefox) equivalent to webkit, at the moment 
             of writing, more stable than webkit.
             It can be in python-gnome2-extras or python-gtkhtml2
             depending on distributions.

The following packages are optional
   python gtkspell & python enchant :  Enable spell checking in the notes,
                    the first contains the libraries, the second is 
                    needed to query the installed languages. Both must
                    be present for spell check to activate
   ttf-freefont     More font support in the reports

No longer needed in 3.1:
   yelp             Gnome help browser. At the moment no help is shipped
No longer needed in 3.2:
   python glade bindings

Documentation
---------------------------------
The User Manual is now maintained on the gramps website,
http://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=User_manual
We might in the future distribute again a manual via gnome-doc-utils, this has not
been decided yet though.


Building on non-Linux systems: i18n support and GNU make
--------------------------------------------------------
If make fails, use gmake (the name FreeBSD gives to GNU make) instead.
You might need a patch also. FreeBSD has in ports a patch (  /usr/ports/science/gramps/files)
you need to apply to po/Makefile.in.in
