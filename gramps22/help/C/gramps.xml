     According to GNU GPL, revision history is mandatory if you are
     modifying/reusing someone else's document.  If not, you can omit
     it.  Remember to remove the &manrevision; entity from the
     revision entries other than the current revision.

     The revision numbering system for GNOME manuals is as follows: 

       * the revision number consists of two components 
       * the first component of the revision number reflects the release version 
         of the GNOME desktop.
       * the second component of the revision number is a decimal unit that is 
         incremented with each revision of the manual.

     For example, if the GNOME desktop release is V2.x, the first
     version of the manual that is written in that desktop time frame
     is V2.0, the second version of the manual is V2.1, etc.

     When the desktop release version changes to V3.x, the revision
     number of the manual changes to V3.0, and so on.

    <title>Preface</title>

    <para>GRAMPS is a software package designed for genealogical research.
    Although similar to other genealogical programs, GRAMPS offers some unique
    and powerful features, which we'll discuss below.</para>

    <para>GRAMPS is an Open Source Software package, which means you are free
    to make copies and distribute it to anyone you like. It's developed and
    maintained by a worldwide team of volunteers whose goal is to make GRAMPS
    powerful, yet easy to use.</para>

    <sect1 id="why-gramps">
      <title>Why use GRAMPS?</title>

      <para>Most genealogy programs allow you to enter information about your
      ancestors and descendants. Typically, they can display family
      relationships through charts, graphs, or reports. Some allow you to
      include pictures or other media. Most let you include information about
      people even if those people are not related to the primary family you
      happen to be researching. And they may include features that let you
      exchange data with other programs and print different types of
      reports.</para>

      <para>GRAMPS has all these capabilities and more. Notably, it allows you
      to integrate bits and pieces of data as they arise from your research
      and to put them in one place -- your computer. You can then use your
      computer to manipulate, correlate, and analyze your data, rather than
      messing with reams of paper.</para>

  <chapter id="gramps-getting-started">
    <title>Getting Started</title>

    <para>In this chapter, we'll begin with the basics. We'll show you how to
    start GRAMPS and how to get help when you need it.</para>

    <sect1 id="gramps-start">
      <title>To Start GRAMPS</title>

      <para>You can start GRAMPS in the following ways:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>From the <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> menu</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Select GRAMPS from the list of programs displayed in your
            computer's Applications menu. (The location and appearance of this
            menu vary slightly from one distribution of Linux to another. On
            the default GNOME desktop, you'll find GRAMPS in the <menuchoice>
                <guimenu>Applications</guimenu>

                <guisubmenu>Other</guisubmenu>
              </menuchoice> menu.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>From the command line</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>If you're adept with Linux and like to work from the command
            line, you can start GRAMPS by calling up a terminal window, typing
            <command>gramps</command>, and then pressing
            <keycap>Enter</keycap>.</para>

            <para>If you would like GRAMPS to open a specific database or to
            import a specific file on startup, you can supply the filename as
            a command line argument:</para>

            <para><filename>gramps filename.grdb</filename></para>

            <para>where <filename>filename.grdb</filename> is the name of the
            file you want to open. The command line provides many more ways to
            start GRAMPS and perform different tasks.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="choose-db-start">
      <title>Choosing a database</title>

      <para>If GRAMPS is started without a database selected, the initial
      screen will have little functionality. Most operations will not be
      available. To load a database, select either <guibutton>New</guibutton>
      to create a new database, or <guibutton>Open</guibutton> to open an
      existing database. GRAMPS keeps track of your recently opened databases,
      and these can be selected by clicking on the arrow next to the
      <guibutton>Open</guibutton> button and choosing from the drop down
      menu.</para>

      <title>Views</title>

      <para>Genealogical information is very broad and can be extremely
      detailed. Displaying it poses a challenge that GRAMPS takes on by
      dividing and organizing the information into a series of Views. Each
      View displays a portion of the total information, selected according to
      a particular category. This will become clearer as we explore the
      different Views, listed below:</para>

      <sect2 id="view-modes">
        <title>Switching Views and Viewing Modes</title>

        <para>As mentioned above there are nine different Views. In addition,
        there are two different Viewing Modes. You can tell at a glance which
        Viewing Mode you are in: If you see icons listed vertically in a
        sidebar at the left of the window, you are in the Sidebar Viewing
        Mode. If instead you see a series of "notebook tabs" (labeled People,
        Relationships, Family List, Pedigree, Events, Sources, Places, Media
        and Repositories) that run horizontally across the window, then you
        are in the Tabbed Viewing Mode. You can switch from one Viewing Mode
        to another by selecting <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>View</guimenu>

            <guimenuitem>Sidebar</guimenuitem>
          </menuchoice> from the Sidebar menu item.</para>

        <para>If you're in the Sidebar Viewing Mode, you can select the View
        you want by clicking one of the sidebar icons.</para>

      <sect2 id="people-view">
        <title>People View</title>

        <para>

	  The People View lists the people stored in the database.
	You'll note that people are grouped according to their family
	names. To the left of each family name is typically either an
	arrow or some other type of indicator. Clicking it once will
	reveal the entire list of people sharing that name. Clicking
	the indicator again will &quot;roll up&quot; the list and show
	only the family name.

	</para>
        <para>

	  By default, the People View, displays the several columns of information
	  about each person. You can add or remove columns to and
          from the display by calling up the <guilabel>Column Editor</guilabel>
          dialog (
	  
	  <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Column Editor</guimenuitem>
          </menuchoice>) 

	  and checking or unchecking the boxes listed. You can
          also change the position of a column in People View by clicking and
          dragging it to a new position in the Editor. Once you have made the
          changes you want, click <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to exit the Editor
          and see your changes in the People View.</para>

        <sect3 id="filters">
          <title>Filters</title>

          <para>Genealogical databases can contain information on many people,
          families, places, and objects. It's therefore possible for a View to
          contain a long list of data that's difficult to work with. GRAMPS
          gives you two different means for controlling this condition by
          allowing you to filter a list to a more manageable size. These
          methods are Search and Filtering. A search will search the text
	  displayed in list, whereas filters display people whose data match
	  the criteria of the filter.
	    </para>

          <para>Search is a simple but fast method of searching the columns
          displayed on the screen. Typing the characters into the Search box
          and clicking the Find button will display only lines that match the
          text.</para>

          <para>Alternatively, you can enable the Filter sidebar, which will
          be displayed on the right hand side of the display. When the filter
          sidebar is displayed, the Search bar is not displayed. The Filter
          side bar allows you to interactively build a set of filter rules
          that can be applied to the display. The filter is applied based on
          the rules and the data, not on the screen display.</para>

	  <tip id="search-tip">
	    <title>Searching vs. Filtering</title>
	    <para>Searching only searches for exact text matches. If the date 
	    displayed is &quot;Jan 1, 2000&quot;, a search of &quot;1/1/2000&quot;
	    will fail, but a filter of &quot;1/1/2000&quot; will match.</para>
	    </tip>

        <para>The Relationships View displays all the relationships of the
        Active Person (the selected person). Specifically, it shows
        his or her parents, siblings, spouses, and children.</para>

        <para>The Relationships View is designed to allow for quick
        navigation. You can quickly change the Active Person simply by
        clicking the name of any person listed on the page. Each name is
        actually a hypertext link, similar to a web page.</para>

              information of the Active Person is displayed. If a photo of the
              person is available, it is shown on the right hand side. Next to
              the person's name is a symbol indicating gender, and an Edit
              button. Clicking the <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> button will
              allow you to edit all of the person's individual information in
              an <guilabel>Edit Person</guilabel> dialog.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>The next section, the Parents section, displays the families
	      in which the person is a child. Since it is possible for a person to 
	      have  multiple sets of parents, it is possible to have several Parents 
	      sections. </para>
	
              <para>You can control how much information is displayed by using the
              <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu. The view menu allows you to show
              or hide details (the birth and death information) and to show or
              hide siblings. Next to each person listed is an
              <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> button, which will allow you to edit
              all the details of that particular person.</para>

              <para>You may add a new set of parents by either
              selecting the <guibutton>Add Parents</guibutton> or the
              <guibutton>Share Parents</guibutton>. The
              <guibutton>Add Parents</guibutton> button will create a
              new family with the Active Person listed as a child. The
              <guibutton>Share Parents</guibutton> button will allow
              you to choose from a list of existing families, and then
              add the person as a child to that family.</para>

	      <para>You may edit an existing parents by selecting the
	      <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> button next to the
	      parents. If you select the <guibutton>Delete</guibutton>
	      next to a set of parents, then the Active Person will be
	      removed as a child from the parents. This button does
	      not delete the parents' relationship.</para>

              <warning>
                <para>If you are not careful, it is possible to create
                multiple families with the same parents. This is rarely what
                the user wants to do. If you attempt to add a new family that
                has the same parents as an existing family, GRAMPS will issue
                a warning dialog. If you get this dialog, you should probably
                Cancel the edit, and then use the
                <guibutton>Select</guibutton> button to select the existing

              <para>Similar to the Parents section is the Family section,
              which displays families where the Active Person is a parent. Because it
              is possible to have multiple families, it is possible to have
              multiple Family sections. Each family section displays the
              spouse and any children.</para>

                relationships between two people. <emphasis>Spouse</emphasis>
                relationships are not required to be only between a male and

                terminology is still used. In the case of male/male or
                female/female relationships, the <emphasis>father</emphasis>
                and <emphasis>mother</emphasis> labels should be considered to

    way to do the same task. We'll try to point out some of these alternatives
    where appropriate.</para>

          <guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice> or click the <guibutton>Open</guibutton> button on the
      Toolbar. The <guilabel>Open database</guilabel> dialog will appear and
      you'll see a list of files. If you don't see the file you're looking
      for, make sure the All files filter is selected. (This dialog has a
      "filetype" filter, meaning it may only be showing files that have a
      certain extension.)</para>

      <para>To open a recently accessed database, choose either <menuchoice>

      <para>GRAMPS allows you to open certain databases that have not been

      databases. But you should be aware that if the XML or GEDCOM database is

        <para>In addition to interacting with GRAMPS through menu items and

        information, see <xref linkend="append-keybind" />.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Now let's take a quick look at how you can enter and edit these

      <sect2 id="gramps-add-pers">
        <title>To Add or Edit a Person</title>

        <para>There are multiple ways to add a person to the database. We will

        to add them from the People View. While you are in the People View
        (<xref linkend="side-nofilt-fig" />), click the
        <guibutton>Add</guibutton> on the toolbar. Enter any data you know

        <para>To edit information about a person already present in the

          <guilabel>Edit...</guilabel> menu items available under
          <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>. Or you can right-click on the person and
          select <guilabel>Add...</guilabel> or <guilabel>Edit...</guilabel>
          from the context menu that pops up.</para>
        </note>

        <para>People can also be added to the database in the Relationships

        sense.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="gramps-spec-rel">
        <title>To Specify a Relationship</title>

        <para>There are two primary ways to specify relationships between
        people - using the Relationships View and using the <guilabel>Edit Family</guilabel> dialog
        from the Family List View. The Family List is usually used to build
        all the relationships within a single family at a time. The
        Relationships View is usually used to build multiple relationships to
        a single person.</para>

        <para>To specify a new relationship to the Active Person, switch to
        the Relationships View (<xref linkend="family-fig" />) and you'll see
        this individual indicated as the "Active Person". Next to the
        <guilabel>Family</guilabel> label is a <guibutton>Add</guibutton>
        button (typically represented by a <guibutton>+</guibutton> sign).
        Clicking the <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button will display the <guilabel>Edit
        Family</guilabel> dialog with the Active Person set as either the father or the
        mother.</para>

        the <guibutton>Select</guibutton> button to the other person. You'll
        then be able to browse through the list of people in the database to
        select the one you want. If not, click the <guibutton>Add</guibutton>
        button. This will allow you to add a new person to the database and to

      <title>Entering and Editing Data: Complete Description</title>

      <para>The previous section offered you a quick overview of how to enter
      and edit data in GRAMPS. This section continues that discussion in much
      greater detail.</para>

      <para>As we have seen above, GRAMPS offers you a series of Views. Each
      of these Views gives you opportunities to enter and edit information. In
      fact, you can often get to the same information from different
      Views.</para>

      <para>In GRAMPS, information is entered and edited through what we call
      dialogs. Since we use that term frequently, we should define what we
      mean by it:</para>

      <para>A dialog is a pop-up window that provides one or more
      forms for entering and editing data that fits a certain
      category. Examples in GRAMPS include the <guilabel>Edit
      Person</guilabel> dialog and the <guilabel>Family
      Editor</guilabel> dialog, among many others.</para>

      <para>A dialog often includes a series of "notebook tabs" that group the
      information into subcategories. For example, the Edit Person dialog has
      notebook tabs for subcategories such as Events, Attributes, Addresses,
      and Notes, among others.</para>

      <note id="edit-button-note">
        <title>Add, Remove, and Edit buttons</title>

        <para>In most cases, GRAMPS uses a <guibutton>+</guibutton> to
        correspond to <guibutton>Add</guibutton>, a <guibutton>-</guibutton>
        correspond to <guibutton>Remove</guibutton>, and an icon of a pen on a
        sheet of paper to denote <guibutton>Edit</guibutton>. We will continue
        referring to the latter as the <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> button,
        while using <guibutton>+</guibutton> and <guibutton>-</guibutton> to
        denote the two former buttons.</para>

              and use the Value of "Enormous" to describe a particularly
              generous person.</para>

              <para>The bottom part of the dialog window displays the list of
              all Attributes stored in the database. The top part shows the

              any). The buttons <guibutton>+</guibutton>,
              <guibutton>Edit</guibutton>, and <guibutton>-</guibutton> let
              you add, modify, and remove an attribute record from the

              <guibutton>-</guibutton> buttons become available only when an

          <title>Date formats and parsing rules</title>

          <para>GRAMPS recognizes dates entered in a variety of formats. The
          default numeric format is that which is conventional for the
          environment is which GRAMPS is operating; that is, DD.MM.YYYY for
          most European countries, MM/DD/YYYY for the U.S., and so on.</para>

          <para>Besides exact dates, GRAMPS recognizes many dates that are not
          regular: before, after, about, ranges and spans. It also understands
          the quality: estimated or calculated. Finally, it supports partial
          dates and many alternative calendars. Below is the list of date
          entry rules to allow precise date parsing.</para>

          <note>
            <title>Date parsing rules</title>

            <para>The list only applies to the English version of GRAMPS. If
            you are using localized version of GRAMPS, your version may or may
            not provide a localized date parser. At the time of this writing,
            localized parsers exist for French, German, Russian, Finnish,
            Dutch and Spanish languages.</para>

            <para>If the localized parser is available for your version,
            chances are that other rules are in effect. If there is no manual
            in your language yet, you may try following your instinct and go
            with the common ways of denoting dates in your language. If all
            else fails, use the <guilabel>Date selection</guilabel> dialog
            described below.</para>

              <para>Regular single dates can be entered just as you would
              write them. Examples: May 24, 1961 or January 1, 2004.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Dates that are not regular should start with the quality:

              <guilabel>calculated</guilabel>, if applicable. Example: est.
              1961, or calc 2005. (Note that a quality does not need to be
              specified for regular dates.)</para>

              <guilabel>about</guilabel>, you scan specify the type by writing
              "before", "after" or "about". If the type is a range, write
              "between DATE and DATE", and if the type is a span, write "from
              DATE to DATE". patterns, where DATE is a single date.</para>

              <para>Examples: est from 2001 to 2003, before June 1975, est

              the calendar to the date string, e.g. "January 9, 1905

              <para>A green circle means that the date is valid and complete
              regular date (e.g. May 24, 1961). In simple terms, green means
              that the date corresponds to a unique date.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Yellow circle means that the date is valid but is not a
              regular date. This could be the date of a different type: a
              before date (before May 25, 1962), an after date (after May,
              1960), an about date (about May 23, 1961), a range (between May
              1, 1961 and May 31, 1961), or a span (from May 1, 1961 to May
              31, 1961). It can also be a complete single date, but with
              quality of Estimated or Calculated. Finally, it could be a
              partial date, i.e. a regular quality single date missing some
              portion, e.g. May 1961 or 1961.</para>

              <para>While partial dates do not uniquely define the day, they

              had surgery"). In such a case the date will be stored as a text
              string and therefore cannot be compared other dates. As you can
              see, it is best to avoid such date entries. It would be better,
              for example, to enter a date of "December 1961" and then to add
              the note "Christmas week of '61."</para>

          <para>The <guilabel>Calendar</guilabel> menu lets you choose a

          you establish the exact date type: Regular, Before, After, About,
          Range, Span, and Text only. You can set the

            recommend this for the following reason: If you enter a date by
            typing it directly into the date field (that is, not via the <guilabel>Date
            selector</guilabel> dialog), your entry will be copied and stored as the text
            comment string when GRAMPS parses the entered text. Thus, any
            comment that may have been there prior to the parsing will be
            overwritten.</para>

              patronymic (a form of father's name used in some languages, e.g.
              Russian), family prefix, suffix, title, and type of the name.
              The information can be typed in the appropriate text entry

              grouping node for a given name, overriding the default grouping
              based on the family name. This may be necessary with similar
              family names that need to be grouped together -- for example
              Russian names Ivanov and Ivanova are considered the same, but
              difference in gender is reflected in different spelling. To
              enable typing into this field, check the

              on the validity of this name -- use spans as necessary. Check

      <title>Navigation</title>

      <para>As long as any database is open, GRAMPS is focused on a single
      person usually referred to as an Active Person. This allows you to view
      or modify the data concerning this person, his or her immediate family,
      etc. Navigating in the database (i.e. moving from person to person) is
      in fact nothing else but changing the Active Person. This section
      describes many alternative ways to navigate through the database using
      both the complex and the convenient interfaces GRAMPS provides. All
      these ways eventually accomplish the same thing, but some are more
      convenient than others, depending what you are doing in GRAMPS at the
      moment.</para>

      <sect2 id="gramps-nav-people">

        View, just select the name of the desired person from the list by
        clicking that list entry. The person you have selected becomes active.

        <para>The Pedigree View (see <xref linkend="pedigree-view" />) also

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            the corresponding right arrow button on the right-hand side of the

            the paternal line. Clicking the lower button will move the tree
            along the maternal line.</para>

            <para>Clicking either of these buttons is completely equivalent to

      <para>Reports are the most common form of the output produced by
      genealogical research. The majority of genealogical software puts a lot
      of emphasis on developing nice looking reports. GRAMPS is no exception
      in this regard, offering a choice of a variety of reports. GRAMPS can
      generate reports in a multitude of open formats, both text based and
      graphical. GRAMPS can also produce screen based reports that are
      convenient for viewing a summary of your database. Finally, GRAMPS can
      generate a web site suitable for immediate posting on the Internet. All
      of these are almost infinitely flexible. If you wish to modify or extend
      the default format of GRAMPS report, you can design and choose the style
      for each of your reports.</para>

      <para>All reports can be accessed through the menu by choosing
      <menuchoice>

        <para>Many of the graphical reports allow you to customize the
        information on the display. Variable substitutions are used to
        substitute date for a particular symbol. There are two styles of
        variables. The difference between the two styles is how empty data is
        handled.</para>

        <para>The first style of variables are preceded by a '$'. If the
        variable evaluates to an empty string, the variable is replaced with
        the empty string. The second style of variables are preceded by a
        '%'. If the variable evaluates to an empty string, the line that
        contains the variable is removed from the output.</para>

              father and mother have numbers 2 and 3, respectively. This rule
              holds for every person while going back in generations: father's
              parents are numbered 4 and 5, and mother's parents are numbered
              6 and 7, fathers always numbered with even and mothers with odd
              numbers. Therefore, for any person having number N in this tree,
              the numbers of father and mother are 2N and 2N+1,

              <listitem>
                <para>Genealogy records can generate a lot of files. Many web
                servers have a difficult time with many files in a single
                directory. The Narrative Web Generator strives to keep the
                number of files per directory to a manageable level. To do
                this, a hierarchy of directories is created. The generated
                files names are not intuitive, but are unique per person.
                Subsequent runs will generate identical file names, making it
                easy to replace files.</para>

                <para>By default, the output files are written to the
                specified directory. Because of the number of files and
                directories that are created, it may be difficult to transfer
                the files to an external web host. To aid in this, you may
                directly create a gzip'd tar file to more easily upload the
                data. This is the format that should be used if you would like

                <para>GRAMPS provides two options to control the privacy of
                your information. If you select the <guilabel>Do not include
                records marked private</guilabel> option, any data that is

                If you select <guilabel>Restrict information on living
                people</guilabel>, GRAMPS will attempt to determine which
                people have the potential of still being alive, and will omit
                these people from the database. Some countries have laws that
                indicate that a certain number of years must pass after
                someone's death before information can be published. The

                <para>The previous web generator allowed you to customize your
                pages using HTML templates. Your data would be substituted for
                certain markers in the code.</para>

                <para>This method proved to be too cumbersome for most users.
                The Narrative Web Page Generator introduces a simpler
                mechanism. On the <guilabel>Page Generation</guilabel> tab,
                you may specify text (including HTML code) that will be
                inserted into each page, separately for the header and the
                footer.</para>

                <para>To create this code, you need to create a Media Object
                marked as an internal note. To create this, add a new Media
                Object in the Media View, and select the internal note option.
                You may then enter your HTML code.</para>

                <para>To insert the code from the internal notes into the web
                pages, select the appropriate Media Objects from the
                <guilabel>HTML user header</guilabel> and <guilabel>HTML user
                footer</guilabel> menus. Two div sections will be added to the
                pages - userheader and userfooter. The corresponding HTML code
                is inserted into the HTML page surrounded by div markers. You
                can customize your style sheet to provide additional
                formatting and positioning information to control these
                sections.</para>

      <title>Running Tools</title>

      <para>GRAMPS tools allow you to perform various types of analysis of
      your genealogical data. Typically, the tools do not produce output in
      form of printouts or files. Instead, they produce screen output
      immediately available for the researcher. However, when appropriate, you
      can save the results of running a tool into a file. Tools present one of
      the major strengths of GRAMPS compared to the most genealogical

        <term>What is GRAMPS?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>GRAMPS is the Genealogical Research and Analysis Management
          Program System. In other words, it is a personal genealogy program
          letting you store, edit, and research genealogical data using the
          powers of your computer.</para>

        <term>Where do I get it and how much does it cost?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>GRAMPS can be downloaded from <ulink type="http"
          url="http://sf.net/projects/gramps">http://sf.net/projects/gramps</ulink>
          at no charge. GRAMPS is an Open Source project covered by the GNU
          General Public License. You have full access to the source code and
          are allowed to distribute the program and source code freely.</para>

      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Does it work with Windows (tm)?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>No. GRAMPS uses the GTK and GNOME libraries. While the GTK
          libraries have been ported to Windows, the GNOME libraries have not.
          This, however, may change in the future.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Does it work with the Mac?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para><ulink type="http" url="http://fink.sourceforge.net"> The Fink
          project</ulink> has ported <ulink type="http"
          url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/gramps"> some older
          versions</ulink> of GRAMPS to OSX (tm). The Mac OSX port is not
          directly supported by the GRAMPS project, primarily because none of
          the GRAMPS developers have access to Mac OSX and because OSX is not
          Free Software.</para>

          <para>This version of GRAMPS (2.2.0) does not appear to have been
          ported by the Fink project. Please contact the Fink project for more
          information.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>What version of GNOME do I need?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>This version of gramps requires GNOME 2.8.0 or higher.
          Previous versions in 1.0.x series required GNOME 2.0.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Is GRAMPS compatible with other genealogical software?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>GRAMPS makes every effort to maintain compatibility with
          GEDCOM, the general standard of recording genealogical information.
          We have import and export filters that enable GRAMPS to read and
          write GEDCOM files.</para>

          <para>It is important to understand that the GEDCOM standard is
          poorly implemented -- virtually every genealogical software has its
          own "flavor" of GEDCOM. As we learn about new flavor, the
          import/export filters can be created very quickly. However, finding
          out about the unknown flavors requires user feedback. Please feel
          free to inform us about any GEDCOM flavor not supported by GRAMPS,
          and we will do our best to support it!</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Can GRAMPS read files created by other genealogy
        programs?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>See above.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Can GRAMPS write files readable by other genealogy
        programs?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>See above.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Can GRAMPS print a genealogical tree for my family?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Yes. Different people have different ideas of what a
          genealogical tree is. Some think of it as a chart going from the
          distant ancestor and listing all his/her descendants and their
          families. Others think it should be a chart going from the person
          back in time, listing the ancestors and their families. Yet other
          people think of a table, text report, etc.</para>

          <para>GRAMPS can produce any of the above, and many more different
          charts and reports. Moreover, the plugin architecture enables users
          (you) to create their own plugins which could be new reports,
          charts, or research tools.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>In what formats can GRAMPS output its reports?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Text reports are available in HTML, PDF, AbiWord, KWord,
          LaTeX, RTF, and OpenOffice formats. Graphical reports (charts and
          diagrams) are available in PostScript, PDF, SVG, OpenOffice, and
          GraphViz formats.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Is GRAMPS compatible with the Internet?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>GRAMPS can store web addresses and direct your browser to
          them. It can import data that you download from the Internet. It can
          export data that you could send over the Internet. GRAMPS is
          familiar with the standard file formats widely used on the Internet
          (e.g. JPEG, PNG, and GIF images, MP3, OGG, and WAV sound files,
          QuickTime, MPEG, and AVI movie files, etc). Other than that, there
          is little that a genealogical program can do with the
          Internet.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Can I create custom reports/filters/whatever?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Yes. There are many levels of customization. One is creating
          or modifying the templates used for the reports. This gives you some
          control over the fonts, colors, and some layout of the reports. You
          can also use GRAMPS controls in the report dialogs to tell what
          contents should be used for a particular report. In addition to
          this, you have an ability to create your own filters -- this is
          useful in selecting people based on criteria set by you. You can
          combine these filters to create new, more complex filters. Finally,
          you have an option to create your own plugins. These may be new
          reports, research tools, import/export filters, etc. This assumes
          some knowledge of programming in Python.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>What standards does GRAMPS support?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>The nice thing about standards is that there never is a
          shortage of them. GRAMPS is tested to support the following flavors
          of GEDCOM: GEDCOM5.5, Brother's Keeper, Family Origins, Family Tree
          Maker, Ftree, GeneWeb, Legacy, Personal Ancestral File, Pro-Gen,
          Reunion, and Visual Genealogie.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>What is the maximum database size (bytes) GRAMPS can
        handle?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>GRAMPS has no hard limits on the size of a database that it
          can handle. Starting with this release, GRAMPS no longer loads all
          data into memory, which allows it to work with a much larger
          database than before. In reality, however, there are practical
          limits. The main limiting factors are the available memory on the
          system and the cache size used for BSDDB database access. With
          common memory sizes these days, GRAMPS should have no problem using
          databases with tens of thousands of people.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>How many people can GRAMPS database handle?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>We have found that on a typical system, GRAMPS tends to bog
          down after the database has around 150,000 people. Again, this is
          dependent on how much memory you have.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Why is GRAMPS running so slowly?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>It does not anymore! Just try out the current version,
          2.2.0.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>My database is really big. Is there a way around loading all the
        data into memory?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Starting with this release, GRAMPS no longer loads all data
          into memory, which allows it to work with a much larger database
          than before.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>I want to rerun the Startup dialog. How do I do this?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>GRAMPS keeps a flag in the GNOME configuration database to
          indicate that the startup dialog has been run. To cause GRAMPS to
          rerun this, the flag needs to be reset. This can be done with the
          following command:</para>

          <para><command>gconftool-2 -u
          /apps/gramps/behavior/startup</command></para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Why are non-Latin characters displayed as garbage in PDF/PS
        reports?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>This is a limitation of the built-in fonts of PS and PDF
          formats. To print non-Latin text, use the Print... in the format
          selection menu of the report dialog. This will use the gnome-print
          backend, which supports PS and PDF creation, as well as direct
          printing.</para>

          <para>If you only have Latin text, the PDF option will produce a
          smaller PDF compared to that created by gnome-print, simply because
          no font information will be embedded.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Why can I not add/remove/edit columns to the lists in People
        View and Family View?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Now you can! Just try out the current version, 2.2.0.</para>

        <term>I would like to contribute to GRAMPS by writing my favorite
        report. How do I do that?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>The easiest way to contribute to reports, filters, tools, etc.
          is to copy an existing GRAMPS report, filter, or tool. If you can
          create what you want by modifying existing code -- great! If your
          idea does not fit into the logic of any existing GRAMPS tool, the

          url="http://gramps.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/GrampsDevelopersPage">following
          page</ulink> may provide some help in writing your own plugin from
          scratch.</para>

          <para>If you need more help or would like to discuss your idea with
          us, please do not hesitate to contact us at <ulink type="mailto"
          url="mailto:gramps-devel@lists.sf.net">gramps-devel@lists.sf.net</ulink></para>

          <para>To test your work in progress, you may save your plugin under
          <replaceable>$HOME/.gramps/plugins</replaceable> directory and it
          should be found and imported on startup. The correctly written
          plugin will register itself with GRAMPS, create menu item, and so
          on.</para>

          <para>If you are happy with your plugin and would like to contribute
          your code back to the GRAMPS project, you are very welcome to do so

        <term>It is obvious that GRAMPS absolutely needs to become a
        (client-server/web-based/PHP/weblog/Javascript/C++/distributed/KDE/Motif/Tcl/Win32/C#/You-name-it)
        application. When is this going to happen?</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>The surest way to see it happen is to get it done by yourself.
          Since GRAMPS is free/open source, nobody prevents you from taking
          all of the code and continuing its development in whatever direction
          you see fit. In doing so, you may consider giving your new project
          another name to avoid confusion with the continuing GRAMPS
          development. If you would like the GRAMPS project to provide advice,
          expertise, filters, etc., we will gladly cooperate with your new
          project, to ensure compatibility or import/export options to your
          new format of a project.</para>

          <para>If, however, you would like the GRAMPS project to adopt
          your strategy, you would need to convince GRAMPS developers that

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Has complete record</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>This rule matches all people whose records are marked as
            complete. Currently, the completeness of personal information is
            marked manually, in the <guilabel>Edit Person</guilabel>
            dialog.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>

            list.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Has text matching substring of</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>This rule matches all people whose records contain specified
            substring. All textual records are searched. Optionally, the
            search can be made case sensitive, or a regular expression
            match.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Everyone</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>This rule matches any person in the database. As such it is
            not very useful on its own except for testing purposes. However,
            it may be useful in combinations with other rules.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>People probably alive</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>This rule matches all people whose records do not indicate
            their death and who are not unreasonably old, judging by their
            available birth data and today's date.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Has a name</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>This rule matches any person whose name matches the
            specified value in full or in part. For example, Marta Ericsdotter
            will be matched by the rule using the value "eric" for the family
            name.</para>

            <para>Separate values can be used for Given name, Family name,
            Suffix, and the Title. The rule returns a match if, and only if,
            all non-empty values are (partially) matched by a person's name.
            To use just one value, leave the other values empty.</para>
          </listitem>

          <term>Has the Id</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>This rule matches any person with a specified GRAMPS ID. The
            rule returns a match only if the ID is matched exactly.</para>

            <para>You can either enter the ID into a text entry field, or
            select a person from the list by clicking
            <guibutton>Select...</guibutton> button. In the latter case, the

    <sect1 id="filtref-event">
      <title>Event filters</title>

      <para>This category includes the following rules that match people based
      on their recorded events:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Has the birth</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>This rule matches people whose birth event matches specified
            values for Date, Place, and Description. The rule returns a match
            even if the person's birth event matches the value partially. The
            matching rules are case-insensitive. For example, anyone born in
            Sweden will be matched by the rule using the value "sw" for the
            Place.</para>

            <para>The rule returns a match if, and only if, all non-empty
            values are (partially) matched by a person's birth. To use just
            one value, leave the other values empty.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Has the death</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>This rule matches people whose death event matches specified
            values for Date, Place, and Description. The rule returns a match
            even if the person's death event matches the value partially. The
            matching rules are case-insensitive. For example, anyone who died
            in Sweden will be matched by the rule using the value "sw" for the
            Place.</para>

            <para>The rule returns a match if, and only if, all non-empty
            values are (partially) matched by a person's death. To use just
            one value, leave the other values empty.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Has source of</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>This rule matches people whose records refer to the
            specified source.</para>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Has the personal event</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>This rule matches people that have a personal event matching
            specified values for the Event type, Date, Place, and Description.
            The rule returns a match even if the person's event matches the
            value partially. The matching rules are case-insensitive. For
            example, anyone who graduated in Sweden will be matched by the
            rule using the Graduation event and the value "sw" for the
            Place.</para>

            <para>The personal events should be selected from a pull-down
            menu. The rule returns a match if, and only if, all non-empty
            values are (partially) matched by the personal event. To use just
            one value, leave the other values empty.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Has the family event</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>This rule matches people that have a family event matching
            specified values for the Event type, Date, Place, and Description.
            The rule returns a match even if the person's event matches the
            value partially. The matching rules are case-insensitive. For
            example, anyone who was married in Sweden will be matched by the
            rule using the Marriage event and the value "sw" for the
            Place.</para>

            <para>The family events should be selected from a pull-down menu.
            The rule returns a match if, and only if, all non-empty values are
            (partially) matched by the personal event. To use just one value,
            leave the other values empty.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>This rule matches people who are present as a witness in the
            event. If the personal or family event type is specified, only the
            events of this type will be searched.</para>

    <title>Command line reference</title>

    <para>This appendix provides the reference to the command line
    capabilities available when launching GRAMPS from the terminal.</para>

    <note>
      <para>GRAMPS was designed to be an interactive program. Therefore it
      uses graphical display and cannot run from the true non-graphical
      console. It would take an enormous amount of effort to enable it to run
      in a text-only terminal. This is why the set of command line options
      does not aim to completely get rid of dependency on the graphical
      display. Rather, it merely makes certain (typical) tasks more
      convenient. It also allows one to execute these tasks from the scripts.
      However, the graphical display must be accessible at all times!</para>
    </note>

    <tip>
      <para>To summarize, the use of the command line options provides
      non-interactive behavior, but does not get rid of graphical display
      dependency. Take it or leave it!</para>
