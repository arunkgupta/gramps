msgstr "GRAMPS er en programpakke som er beregnet på slektsforskning.  Selv om GRAMPS likner på andre slektsforskerprogram, tilbyr GRAMPS noen unike og kraftige muligheter som blir diskutert senere."

msgid "GRAMPS is an Open Source Software package, which means you are free to make copies and distribute it to anyone you like. It's developed and maintained by a worldwide team of volunteers whose goal is to make GRAMPS powerful, yet easy to use."
msgstr "GRAMPS er et program basert på åpen kikdekode, noe som betyr at du står fritt til å kopiere og distribuere det som du selv ønsker.  Det er også utviklet og vedlikeholdt av en verdensomspennende gjeng av frivillige som har som mål å gjøre GRAMPS både kraftig og lett å bruke."

msgid "Most genealogy programs allow you to enter information about your ancestors and descendants. Typically, they can display family relationships through charts, graphs, or reports. Some allow you to include pictures or other media. Most let you include information about people even if those people are not related to the primary family you happen to be researching. And they may include features that let you exchange data with other programs and print different types of reports."
msgstr "De fleste slektsforskerprogram gir deg mulighet til å skrive inn informasjon om dine forfedre eller etterkommere.  Typisk kan de fremstille familierelasjoner gjennom tavler, grafer og rapporter.  Noen gir deg mulighet for å ta med bilder eller andre media.  De fleste gir deg mulighet til å ta med informasjon om personer selv om de ikke er direkte i slekt med den familien du tilfeldigvis forsker på.  Og de har kanskje finesser som lar deg utveksle data med andre program og skrive ut ulike typer rapporter."

#: C/gramps.xml:313(para)
msgid "GRAMPS has all these capabilities and more. Notably, it allows you to integrate bits and pieces of data as they arise from your research and to put them in one place -- your computer. You can then use your computer to manipulate, correlate, and analyze your data, rather than messing with reams of paper."
msgstr "GRAMPS har alle disse mulighetene og flere.  Det gir deg mulighetene til å integrere deler og biter av data etterhvert som de kommer fram i forskningen din og sette dem sammen på ett sted -- i din datamaskin.  Du kan da bruke din datamaskin til å manipulere, sammenlikne og analysere dine data istedet for å rote gjennom digre stabler med papir."

You can also use GRAMPS controls in the report dialogs to tell what contents should be used for a particular report. In addition to this, you have an ability to create your own filters -- this is useful in selecting people based on criteria set by you. You can combine these filters to create new, more complex filters. Finally, you have an option to create your own plugins.
