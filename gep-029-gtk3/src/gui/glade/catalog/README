This directory contains the catalog needed to use the GRAMPS glade files 
in glade.

Assuming you are in the root svn directory do:

GLADE_CATALOG_SEARCH_PATH=src/gui/glade/catalog GLADE_MODULE_SEARCH_PATH=src/gui/glade/catalog/ glade

However, this does no longer work for python modules (since 3.8), so the gramps widgets are not in the catalog at this moment.
As project settings:

*format: gtkbuilder
*unique names in toplevel (so not project)
