This file contains some useful details on the installation from source code
for GRAMPS. It does not cover installation of a pre-built binary package.
For that use your package manager, the rest is done by the packager.


configure vs autogen scripts
----------------------------
If you are building from released tarball, you should be able to just
run "./configure && make". However, if you're building from the CVS,
the configure is not present. You should auto-generate it by
running ./autogen.sh and then "make" and, finally, "make install".


Regular vs local installation
-----------------------------
This version of gramps requires, among others, the two things to be done:
gconf schemas and mime types for gramps MUST be properly installed.
The usual ./configure, make, and make install as a root should do the trick.
But be careful if you're using the non-default options or would like
to install without being root.

The latter is possible, but you should supply additional arguments to
autogen or configure:
   --with-gconf-source=xml::$HOME/.gconf
   --with-gconf-schema-file-dir=$HOME
   --with-mime-dir=$HOME/.local/share/mime
Most likely, such local install will also need some prefix with write
permissions for you:
   --prefix=$HOME/my_gramps_path

Whether you're doing local install or regular install,
YOU MUST INSTALL GCONF SCHEMAS AND MIME TYPES.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!


Packager's issues
------------------
The above mentioned gconf schemas and mime types must be installed.
However, the update-mime-database and the gconftool-2 calls to process
the newly installed types and schemas must be done in POST-INSTALLATION.
In packager's world, the install happens on packager's machine
into something like /tmp/gramps-tmp. However, the postinstall
should happen on the user's machine.

To assist with that, there's an argument available in configure
(or autogen, which will pass it to configure) which disables
the gconf schema and mime type processing:
   --enable-packager-mode
This argument should disable postinstall calls made during
make install, and print a nasty warning during configure.
IT IS PACKAGER'S RESPONSIBILITY to follow the advice given
by the configure output and to copy the appropriate code
from the src/data/Makefile.am into the pos-tinstall (and post-uninstall)
of the particular packaging system.
