    <sect2 id="import-data"> 
      <title>Importing Data</title> 
      <para>Importing allows you to incorporate the data from other 
      databases into your currently open &app; database. Currently, 
      &app; can import data from three different 
      formats: GEDCOM, &app; database, and &app; package. All of these are
      available as items of <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Import</guisubmenu></menuchoice> submenu.</para>
      
      <para>Both &app; database, and &app; package are native &app; 
      formats. The package is a compressed archive containing the database 
      file and all media objects (images, sound files, etc.) that the 
      database refers to. The package is created by exporting data to 
      the &app; package, see <xref linkend="export-data"/>. 
      The &app; database is a directory containing the database file and 
      the local media objects. The database may also have references 
      to non-local (external) media objects, therefore it is not guaranteed 
      to be completely portable. The &app; database is created by saving 
      the data in a usual way, see <xref linkend="save-db"/>.
      </para>

      <para>Note that the difference between opening &app; database and 
      importing from &app; database is that importing incorporates all the 
      data into your currently open database, if any. </para>

      <para>After choosing an import format, you will be prompted with the
      <guilabel>Open File</guilabel> dialog asking you to specify the 
      file name from which to import. For GEDCOM and 
      &app; package, select an appropriate file. 
      For &app; database, select a directory which stores 
      the database and all media files (if any).</para> 

      <para>Upon starting the GEDCOM import, &app; 
      will display the following GEDCOM import dialog with the summary of the 
      information about the data. The information is updated as the import
      progresses. </para>

      <para>Exporting allows you to share any portion of your &app; database 
      with other researchers as well as to make your database completely 
      portable to another computer. Currently, &app; 
      can export data  to four different formats: CD, GEDCOM, &app; package,

      <guisubmenu>Export</guisubmenu></menuchoice> submenu.</para>

      <para>Exporting to CD will prepare you database directory with all its

      selecting <menuchoice><guimenu>Go</guimenu>  
      <guisubmenu>CD Creator</guisubmenu></menuchoice> in Nautilus menu. Your

      to limit living people''s data to family ties. With this option, 
      information concerning birth, death, addresses, various events, 
      etc. will be omitted in the exported GEDCOM file. If this option is selected, 
      you can further choose whether to use the word "Living" as first name, exclude
      notes, and exclude sources for the living people. Check <guilabel>Reference

	</para>

    <para>The <guilabel>Format</guilabel> option allows you to set the

    For example, Aunt Martha''s memoirs may mention that her great grandson Paul 
    was married, so the researcher may assume that this relationship (between 
    Paul and his wife) existed and cite the memoirs as the source for this 
    assumption. NOTE: sources documenting specific events such as marriages 
    or divorces are better filed in relation to those events, under the 
    <guilabel>Events</guilabel> tab.
	</para>
    <para>The central part displays the list of all source references stored 
    in the database for this relationship. The

	allows you to view or modify the data concerning this person, 
	his or her immediate family, etc. Navigating in the database (i.e. 
	moving from person to person) is in fact nothing else but changing 
	the Active person. This section describes many alternative ways
	to navigate through the database using both the complex and the 
        convenient interfaces &app; provides. All these ways eventually 
        accomplish the same thing, but some are more convenient than others,

	<para> This report generates web pages, either for a selected

	for this report are broken down into contents, privacy, and advanced 
	options. The contents options include the filter (determine the 
	scope of the database to consider), 
	destination directory for the images, an optional short ancestor tree, 
        and a link to the index page.
	Privacy options allow you to omit private records, restrict 
	information on living people, skip images (either all or only 
        those of living people), and omit comments and text in source 
        information. Finally, the advanced options allow you to include 
        the optional &app; ID, create a GENDEX index, and specify the 
        extension of the resulting files. </para>
