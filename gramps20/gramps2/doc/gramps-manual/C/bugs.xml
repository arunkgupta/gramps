  <title>Known Bugs and Limitations</title>

<para>The known limitations include the BSDDB performance issues related
to caching and the memory size. As long as the BSDDB cache fits completely
into the available memory on the system, the performance should be
adequate. When the cache size exceeds that of the free memory and
portions of database cache start to be swapped onto the disk, the performance
degrades appreciably. This can be solved by adjusting the BSDDB cache
size for the large databases.
