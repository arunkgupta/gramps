According to GNU GPL, revision history is mandatory if you are
modifying/reusing someone else's document.  If not, you can omit it.
Remember to remove the &manrevision; entity from the revision entries other
than the current revision.
The revision numbering system for GNOME manuals is as follows:
* the revision number consists of two components 
* the first component of the revision number reflects the release version 
  of the GNOME desktop.
* the second component of the revision number is a decimal unit that is 
  incremented with each revision of the manual.
For example, if the GNOME desktop release is V2.x, the first version of the 
manual that is written in that desktop time frame is V2.0, the second version 
of the manual is V2.1, etc. When the desktop release version changes to V3.x, 
the revision number of the manual changes to V3.0, and so on.

    <releaseinfo>
      This manual describes version &appversion; of GRAMPS.
    </releaseinfo> 

  </bookinfo> 

<preface id="gramps-preface">

    <title>Preface</title> 

    <para>GRAMPS is a software package designed for genealogical
    research. Although similar to other genealogical programs, GRAMPS
    offers some unique and powerful features, which we'll discuss
    below. </para>

    <para>GRAMPS is a Open Source Software package, which means you
    are free to make copies and distribute it to anyone you like.
    It's developed and maintained by a worldwide team of volunteers
    whose goal is to make GRAMPS powerful, yet easy to use.</para>

    <sect1 id="why-gramps">
      <title>Why use GRAMPS?</title>

      <para>Most genealogy programs allow you to enter information
      about your ancestors and descendants. Typically, they can
      display family relationships through charts, graphs, or
      reports. Some allow you to include pictures or other media. Most
      let you include information about people even if those people
      are not related to the primary family you happen to be
      researching. And they may include features that let you exchange
      data with other programs and print different types of
      reports. </para>

      <para>GRAMPS has all these capabilities and more. Notably, it
      allows you to integrate bits and pieces of data as they arise
      from your research and to put them in one place &mdash; your
      computer. You can then use your computer to manipulate,
      correlate, and analyze your data, rather than messing with reams
      of paper. </para>

    </sect1>
    
    <sect1 id="whats-new">
      <title>What's new since 1.0.X</title>

      <para>If you are new to GRAMPS, it may not be important for you
      to know how GRAMPS version 2.0.0 (the object of this manual)
      differs from previous versions of the software. You may
      therefore elect to skip this section.</para>

      <para>However, if you are already familiar with GRAMPS and are
      interested in the new aspects and features of version 2.0.0,
      please read on.</para>

      <variablelist>

      <varlistentry><term>Berkeley database backend</term>
	<listitem>

  	  <para>We've adopted the Berkeley database format (BSDDB) as
	  the default for GRAMPS. Berkeley is the most widely used
	  open source developer database in the world.</para>

	  <para>This change allowed us to overcome issues of
	  performance and memory requirements that beset version
	  1.0.X. With the new back-end, database sizes of up to a
	  hundred thousand people no longer present a major
	  obstacle.</para>

	  <para>The default extension for GRAMPS' BSDDB database files
	  is grdb. The new format is open and fully documented in the
	  developer's API reference distributed with the source code
	  of GRAMPS. </para>

	  <note id="default-format">
	    <title>Preferred format</title> 

	    <para>The preferred and default format for &app; is the
	    new BSDDB format.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>A consequence of the new database back-end is that the
	  &quot;saving&quot; function is no longer necessary (or even
	  possible). Now, once you approve changes, they are
	  immediately applied; this means that clicking
	  <guibutton>OK</guibutton> in the Person, Family, Source,
	  Place, Media object, or Event editor immediately records
	  changes to the database. </para>

	  <para>In previous versions, you could &quot;quit without
	  saving.&quot; This option no longer exists per se; however,
	  in version 2.0.0, you can achieve the same effect if you
	  abandon or &quot;cancel&quot; all changes and then
	  quit.</para>

	  <para>Also, it is now possible to undo recent
	  actions.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry><term>Other database back-ends</term>
        <listitem>
	
	  <para>Along with the BSDDB backend, we've incorporated
	  &quot;in-memory&quot; database handling for the GRAMPS XML
	  and GEDCOM formats. This means you can now open files in
	  those two formats and work with their data without having to
	  first create a new database and import data into it. Since
	  this approach requires GRAMPS to hold all the data in
	  memory, it is only useful for small databases (depending on
	  available memory size).</para>

	  <warning id="gedcom-editing">
	    <title>GEDCOM Editing</title> 

	    <para>Please keep in mind that some information in a
	    GEDCOM file may be lost during import into GRAMPS. Simply
	    opening and viewing the file will not change it. However,
	    if any changes were made and they were not abandoned upon
	    exit, exiting GRAMPS will save the data, with the possible
	    data loss.</para>
	  </warning>

	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Desktop integration</term>
	<listitem>

	<para>We've improved the way GRAMPS integrates with the GNOME
	desktop interface common to many Linux distributions. All file
	formats recognized by GRAMPS are now registered as mime types;
	each has its own icon and has GRAMPS as its default
	handler. Thus, if you double-click on any file having one of
	these formats, GRAMPS will launch and open the file.</para>

	<para>We've also added support for GNOME's &quot;recent
	documents&quot; function and have incorporated this function
	within GRAMPS itself.</para>

	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Interface improvements</term>
	<listitem>

	<para>We've made numerous changes in the interface. Most of
	them are subtle and incremental improvements, and all of them
	cannot be listed here. The most notable are:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Removal of alphabetical tabs.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Ability to add/remove/rearrange columns in list views.</para>

	    reports now remember the options you configure for
	    them.</para>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>It is possible to generate reports from the command
	    line, without launching an interactive GRAMPS
	    session.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The report API is much simpler now, making it easy to
	    write custom reports.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>A single code instance may be used for a standalone
	    report, a book item, and a command-line report. </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Internationalization</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The approach for entering and displaying dates has
	  been completely reworked. The new framework allows for a
	  deeper localization of displayed dates than was ever
	  possible using the translatable strings.</para>
 	  <para>The internationalization of names has also been
	  improved. Names can be grouped under a non-default
	  string. Patronymic names are supported, and it is easy to
	  program new ways to display names in the manner customary to
	  a given culture or language.</para>
	</listitem>
       </varlistentry>

    <title>Views</title>

    <para>Genealogical information is very broad and can be extremely
    detailed. Displaying it poses a challenge that GRAMPS takes on by
    dividing and organizing the information into a series of
    Views. Each View displays a portion of the total information,
    selected according to a particular category. This will become
    clearer as we explore the six different Views, listed
    below:</para>

    <itemizedlist>	
      <listitem><para>People View</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Family View</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Pedigree View</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Sources View</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Places View</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Media View</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Before we launch into a description of each View,
    let's first explain how to switch between Views.</para>

    <sect2 id="view-modes">
      <title>Switching Views and Viewing Modes</title>

      <para>As mentioned above there are six different Views. In
      addition, there are two different Viewing Modes. You can tell at
      a glance which Viewing Mode you are in: If you see icons listed
      vertically in a sidebar at the left of the window, you are in
      the Sidebar Viewing Mode. If instead you see a series of
      &quot;notebook tabs&quot; (labeled People, Family, Pedigree, Sources,
      Places, Media) that run horizontally across the window, then you
      are in the Tabbed Viewing Mode. You can switch from one Viewing
      Mode to another by selecting <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Sidebar</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Sidebar menu item.</para>

      <para>If you're in the Sidebar Viewing Mode, you can select the View 
      you want by clicking one of the sidebar icons.</para>

    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="people-view">
      <title>People View</title>
      <para>
        When &app; first opens a database, it displays the
	People View (<xref linkend="side-nofilt-fig"/> and <xref
	linkend="noside-nofilt-fig"/>). This view lists
	all the people stored in the database.
      </para>
      <para> 

      You'll note that people are grouped according to their family
      names. To the left of each family name is an arrow. Clicking it
      once will reveal the entire list of people sharing that
      name. Clicking the arrow again will &quot;roll up&quot; the
      list and show only the family name.

      </para>
      <para>

        By default, the People View, displays the following columns:
        <guilabel>Names</guilabel>, &app; <guilabel>ID</guilabel>
        numbers, <guilabel>Gender</guilabel>, and their
        <guilabel>Birth</guilabel> and <guilabel>Death
        dates</guilabel>.  You can add or remove columns to and from
        the display by calling up the <guilabel>Column
        Editor</guilabel> dialog
        (<menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Column
        Editor</guimenuitem></menuchoice>) and checking or unchecking
        the boxes listed. You can also change the position of a column
        in People View by clicking and dragging it to a new position
        in the Editor. Once you have made the changes you want, click
        <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to exit the Editor and see your
        changes in the People View.

	<para>

	Genealogical databases can contain information on many people,
	families, places, and objects. It's therefore possible for a
	View to contain a long list of data that's difficult to
	work with.  &app; gives you a means for controlling this
	condition by allowing you to filter a list to a more
	manageable size.

	When &app; opens a database, no filtering is in effect. In

	</menuchoice>. This will place a new menu just above the list
	of People. Click on the double arrows of this menu to get a
	pop-up list of all the criteria by which you can filter the
	People listed. Choose a filter (for example, &quot;Males&quot;
	or &quot;People with children&quot;) and click

	Pedigree View gives you an additional, advanced way of

	</para>

	<itemizedlist>

	    <para>
	    The Anchor Person (and his/her generation) is labeled as 
	    <guilabel>0</guilabel>.

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	    In all cases, the number represents the number of

	    pedigree line and see the number of generations removed
	    from the Anchor Person.

	<para>

	To set the anchor, select the person you want as the Active
	person (recall that you can do so in the Pedigree View by
	clicking the line that leads to the person from his or her
	child). Then, while in Pedigree View, right click anywhere in
	the main window. A context menu will appear. Select
	<guilabel>Set anchor</guilabel> and you will see the Active
	person indicated as the anchor in the lower left corner.
	This newly established Anchor Person will remain in effect

          The Media View is a list of Media Objects used in the
	  database.  Media Objects are any files that relate somehow
	  to the stored genealogical data. Technically, any file can
	  be stored as a Media Object. Most frequently, these are
	  images, audio files, animation files, etc. The list box on
	  the bottom lists the <guilabel>Name</guilabel>,
	  <guilabel>ID</guilabel>, <guilabel>Type</guilabel>, and
	  <guilabel>Path</guilabel> of the Media Object. The
	  <guilabel>Column Editor</guilabel> dialog may be used to
	  rearrange the displayed columns, which obey usual sorting
	  rules. The top part of the GRAMPS window shows a preview (if
	  available) and information about the Media Object.

    much greater detail.
    </para><para>
    As we have seen above, GRAMPS offers you a series of Views. Each
    of these Views gives you opportunities to enter and edit
    information. In fact, you can often get to the same information
    from different Views.
    </para><para>
    In GRAMPS, information is entered and edited through what we call
    dialogs. Since we use that term frequently, we should define what
    we mean by it:
    </para><para>
    A dialog is a pop-up window that provides one or more forms for
    entering and editing data that fits a certain category. Examples
    in GRAMPS include the Edit Person dialog and the
    Marriage/Relationship dialog, among many others.
    </para><para>
    A dialog often includes a series of &quot;notebook tabs&quot; that
    group the information into subcategories.  For example, the Edit
    Person dialog has notebook tabs for subcategories such as Events,
    Attributes, Addresses, and Notes, among others.

    <note id="edit-button-note">
      <title>Add, Remove, and Edit buttons</title>

      In most cases, GRAMPS uses a <guibutton>+</guibutton> to
      correspond to <guibutton>Add</guibutton>, a
      <guibutton>-</guibutton> correspond to
      <guibutton>Remove</guibutton>, and an icon of a pen on a sheet
      of paper to denote <guibutton>Edit</guibutton>. We will continue
      referring to the latter as the <guibutton>Edit</guibutton>

              A green circle means that the date is valid and complete
              regular date (e.g. May 24, 1961). In simple terms, green

              Yellow circle means that the date is valid but is not a
	      regular date. This could be the date of a different
	      type: a before date (before May 25, 1962), an after date
	      (after May, 1960), an about date (about May 23, 1961), a
	      range (between May 1, 1961 and May 31, 1961), or a span
	      (from May 1, 1961 to May 31, 1961). It can also be a
	      complete single date, but with quality of Estimated or
	      Calculated. Finally, it could be a partial date, i.e. a
	      regular quality single date missing some portion,

	      case the date will be stored as a text string and
	      therefore cannot be compared other dates.  As you can
	      see, it is best to avoid such date entries. It would be
	      better, for example, to enter a date of &quot;December
	      1961&quot; and then to add the note &quot;Christmas week

	  If you have an important comment to make about a date, you
	  are better off doing so in a Note that corresponds to the
	  event than in the Text comment field of the Date selection
	  dialog. We recommend this for the following reason: If you
	  enter a date by typing it directly into the date field (that
	  is, not via the Date selector dialog), your entry will be
	  copied and stored as the text comment string when GRAMPS
	  parses the entered text. Thus, any comment that may have
	  been there prior to the parsing will be overwritten.

              The <guilabel>General</guilabel> tab allows editing of
	      general information about the name: given name, family
	      name, patronymic (a form of father's name used in some
	      languages, e.g. Russian), family prefix, suffix, title,
	      and type of the name. The information can be typed in
	      the appropriate text entry fields. The family name and
	      the type can be also selected from available choices
	      listed in the appropriate drop-down menus. </para>
	      <para><guilabel>Options</guilabel> allow you to adjust
	      specific grouping, sorting, and displaying properties of
	      this name, as well as to provide the date corresponding
	      to the name. The <guilabel>Grouping</guilabel> field
	      provides an alternative grouping node for a given name,
	      overriding the default grouping based on the family
	      name. This may be necessary with similar family names
	      that need to be grouped together -- for example Russian
	      names Ivanov and Ivanova are considered the same, but
	      difference in gender is reflected in different
	      spelling. To enable typing into this field, check the
	      <guilabel>Override</guilabel> check button. The
	      <guilabel>Sort as</guilabel> and <guilabel>Display
	      as</guilabel> determine the manner in which the name
	      appears in the People View and in the reports.  The
	      <guilabel>Date</guilabel> can provide information on the
	      validity of this name -- use spans as necessary.  Check
	      the <guilabel>Private record</guilabel> box to mark this

          To make a merge, exactly two records have to be selected in
	  the appropriate view (People View, Sources View, or Places
	  View).  This is accomplished by selecting one entry and then
	  selecting another person while holding down
	  <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key.

        As long as any database is open, &app; is focused on a single
	person usually referred to as an Active person. This allows
	you to view or modify the data concerning this person, his or
	her immediate family, etc. Navigating in the database (i.e.
	moving from person to person) is in fact nothing else but
	changing the Active person. This section describes many

	the People View, just select the name of the desired person

        The Pedigree View (see <xref linkend="pedigree-view"/>) also
        allows you to move along the family tree.  The benefit of this
        method is that you can see more than one generation of the
        family tree. Also, you can jump directly from a great-grandson
        to a great-grandfather without going through the intermediate
        generations.

        Note that after changing the active person in the Pedigree
	View, the display is re-adjusted to show four generations,
	starting from the newly selected Active person. When in the
	Pedigree View, you can easily navigate between the members of
	the displayed family tree as follows:

      </para>

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>

	    To make a child of the currently active person (if any)
	    the active person, click the left arrow button to the left
	    of the corresponding box. If there is more than one child,
	    the button expands to the menu listing the children to
	    choose from.

          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>

            To move the whole family tree one generation back, click
	    on the corresponding right arrow button on the right-hand
	    side of the display area. Clicking the upper button will
	    move the tree along the paternal line. Clicking the lower
	    button will move the tree along the maternal line.

          </para>
          <para> 

	    Clicking either of these buttons is completely equivalent

        You can also quickly access any of the spouses, siblings,

    <title>Generating Reports</title>
    <para> 
      Reports are the most common form of the output produced by
      genealogical research. The majority of genealogical software
      puts a lot of emphasis on developing nice looking reports. &app;
      is no exception in this regard, offering a choice of a variety
      of reports.  &app; can generate reports in a multitude of open
      formats, both text based and graphical. &app; can also produce
      screen based reports that are convenient for viewing a summary
      of your database.  Finally, &app; can generate a web site
      suitable for immediate posting on the Internet. All of these are
      almost infinitely flexible.  If you wish to modify or extend the
      default format of &app; report, you can design and choose the
      style for each of your reports.
    </para>
    <para> 
      All reports can be accessed through the menu by choosing
      <menuchoice>
	<guimenu>Reports</guimenu>
	<guisubmenu>
	  <replaceable>Report Type</replaceable>
	</guisubmenu>
        <guimenuitem>
	  <replaceable>Particular Report</replaceable>
	</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>. 
      Alternatively, you can browse the complete selection of
      available reports along with their brief descriptions in a
      <guilabel>Report Selection</guilabel> dialog invoked by clicking
      the <guibutton>Reports</guibutton> icon on the toolbar.

      <title>Substitution Values</title>
      <para>
        Many of the graphical reports allow you to customize the 
        information on the display. Variable substituions are used
        to substitute date for a particular symbol. There are two 
	styles of variables. The difference between the two styles 
	is how empty data is handled.
      </para>
      <para>
        The first style of variables are preceeded by a '$'. If
	the variable evaluates to an empty string, the variable is
	replaced with the empty string. The second style of 
	variables are preceeded by a '%'. If the variable evaluates
	to an empty string, the line that contains the variable is
	removed from the output.

        Currently, the only available report under this category is
        the Book Report.

      <para> 

        The Book Report creates a single document (i.e. a Book)
        containing a collection of graphical and textual reports.
        Consequently, this allows for a very rich set of documents
        that &app; can produce.

        When Book Report is selected, the following book configuration
        dialog appears:

        The <guilabel>Book name</guilabel> text entry field is used to
        save the book (a set of configured selections) for future use.
        The top pane lists the items available for inclusion in the
        book. The bottom pane lists the currently selected items in
        the order they will appear in the book.

        The horizontal set of buttons by the <guilabel>Book

      <para> 

        The vertical set of buttons to the right of the bottom pane
	operates on the selected book item. Click the

	the available list to the current book. Click the
	<guibutton>Remove</guibutton> button to remove an item from

      </para>
      <para> 

        The configuration dialogs invoked by
        <guibutton>Setup</guibutton> are item-specific. If you choose
        not to configure the item, same defaults will be used for all
        needed options. The common option for almost all book items is
        the center person: the person on whom the item is
        centered. Thanks to this option, you can create a book with
        items centered on different people (e.g. your mom's and dad's
        ancestors as separate chapters). By default, the center person
        is set to the active person.

      </para>
      <para>

        Almost all items available for inclusion in the book are
        textual or graphical reports, and are therefore available in
        the form of standalone reports. The exception is the following
        items which are only available as book items:

              This item produces a customized Title page. You can
	      configure the text of title, subtitle, and the footer of
	      the page.  An image can be optionally placed between the
	      subtitle and the footer.  Because of its

        This category contains reports that produce code intended to

	GraphViz description of the graph.

      </para>
      <para>

        The Relationship Graph creates a complex relationship graph in
	GraphViz format. The GraphViz <command>dot</command> tool can
	transform the graph into postscript, jpeg, png, vrml, svg, and
	other formats. GraphViz tools are freely available from the
	<ulink url="http://www.graphviz.org" type="http">GraphViz

          Genealogy records can generate a lot of files. Many web
          servers have a difficult time with many files in a single
          directory. The Narrative Web Generator strives to keep the
          number of files per directory to a managable level. To do
          this, a hierarchy of directores is created. The generated
          files names are not intuitive, but are unique per person.
          Subsequent runs will geneate identical file names, making
          it easy to replace files.</para>
          
          <para>
          By default, the output files are written to the specified
          directory. Because of the number of files and directories
          that are created, it may be difficult to transfer the files
          to an external web host. To aid in this, you may directly
          create a gzip'd tar file to more easily upload the data.
          This is the format that should be used if you would like
          to take advantage of the free genealogy page hosting at the
          <ulink url="http://family.gramps-project.org"

          the Note's text is used for the text of the page. A second page, the

          <guilabel>Introduction Media/Note ID</guilabel> menu.</para>

          &app; will attempt to determine which people have the potential of still

          someone's death before information can be published. The <guilabel>Years

          Two div sections will be added to the pages - userheader and userfooter.

        <para>

	  The Custom Filter Editor builds custom filters that can be
	  used to select people included in reports, exports, and
	  other tools and utilities. This is in fact a very powerful
	  tool in genealogical analysis.

        </para>
        <para>

	  When you launch it, the <guilabel>User defined
	  filters</guilabel> dialog appears that lists all the filters
	  (if any) previously defined by you. Click the
	  <guibutton>Add...</guibutton> button to define a new filter.
	  Once you have designed your filters, you can edit, test, and
	  delete selected filters using the
	  <guibutton>Edit...</guibutton>,
	  <guibutton>Test...</guibutton>, and
	  <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> buttons, respectively. All the
	  filters displayed in the list will be automatically saved
	  along with your database and will be available with
	  subsequent sessions of &app;.

	    A filter you have already designed may be used as a rule

	  Scratch Pad supports addresses, attributes (both personal

	  objects references, source references, URLs, and of course
	  textual information of notes and comments. To store any type
	  of these records, simply drag the existing record on to the
	  Scratch Pad from the corresponding editor dialog. To reuse
	  the record, drag it from the Scratch Pad on to the
	  corresponding place in the editor, e.g. Address tab,
	  Attribute tab, etc.

	    Some objects are showing the link icon on the left. This

	    itself.

	  </para>
          <para>

	    For example, the media object file will not be duplicated.

	        For example, you may want to make sure that nobody in

		common sense, such a record would indicate an
		error. However, it is not a consistency error in the
		database. Besides, someone might have a child at the
		age of 98 (although this rarely happens). The Verify
		tool will display everything that violates your
		criteria so that you can check whether the record is
		erroneous or not. The ultimate decision is yours.

  <title>Known Bugs and Limitations</title>

<para>The known limitations include the BSDDB performance issues related
to caching and the memory size. As long as the BSDDB cache fits completely
into the available memory on the system, the performance should be
adequate. When the cache size exceeds that of the free memory and
portions of database cache start to be swapped onto the disk, the performance
degrades appreciably. This can be solved by adjusting the BSDDB cache
size for the large databases.
