  <title>Getting Started</title> 
    
  <para>
  In this chapter, we'll begin with the basics. We'll show you how
  to start &app; and how to get help when you need it.
  </para>

<!-- ================ Getting Started Subsection ====== -->

  <sect1 id="gramps-start">
    <title>To Start GRAMPS</title>
    <para>
      You can start &app; in the following ways:
    </para> 
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>From the <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> menu</term>
	<listitem>

	  <para>Select &app; from the list of programs displayed in
	  your computer's Applications menu. (The location and
	  appearance of this menu vary slightly from one distribution
	  of Linux to another. On the default GNOME desktop, you'll
	  find &app; in the
	  <menuchoice><guimenu>Applications</guimenu><guisubmenu>Other</guisubmenu></menuchoice>
	  menu.</para>

        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>From the command line</term>
    	<listitem>
          <para>
  	    If you're adept with Linux and like to work from the command
	    line, you can start &app; by calling up a terminal window,
	    typing <command>gramps</command>, and then pressing
	    <keycap>Enter</keycap>.
          </para>
	  <para>
	    If you would like GRAMPS to open a specific database or to 
	    import a specific file on startup, you can supply the filename 
	    as a command line argument:
          </para>
	  <para>
	    <filename>gramps filename.grdb</filename>
    	  </para> 
    	  <para>
            where <filename>filename.grdb</filename> is the name of
  	    the file you want to open. The command line provides many
   	    more ways to start &app; and perform different tasks. The
  	    detailed reference to the command line options is found
  	    in <xref linkend="append-cmdline"/>.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="run-1st-time">
    <title>Running GRAMPS for the first time</title>
    <para> 
      The first time you run the program, GRAMPS will display the
      &quot;Getting Started&quot; dialogs. Follow the directions that
      guide you through <guilabel>Researcher information</guilabel>,
      <guilabel>Numerical date formats</guilabel>, <guilabel>Alternate
      calendar support</guilabel>, and <guilabel>the LDS
      extensions</guilabel> sections. You should find them to be
      self-explanatory.
    </para>
    
    <note id="note-dialog">
      <title>Dialog boxes</title>
      <para>We'll make frequent reference in this manual to
      dialogs. A dialog is simply a pop-up window into which you can
      enter information.</para>
    </note>

    <para>We recommend you enter your personal information when GRAMPS
    prompts you for it. GRAMPS uses this information strictly so it
    can create valid GEDCOM output files (which require information
    about the files' creator). If you wish, you can choose not to
    supply this information, but be aware that unless and until you
    do, any GEDCOM files you export will not be valid.</para>

      If &app; is started without a database selected, the following

    <para>To open a database that you have recently opened, choose the 
    top selection, select your database from the menu and 
    click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.</para> 

    <para>To open an existing database you have not recently opened,
    choose the middle selection and click
    <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. &app; will then ask you to specify the
    name of the database you wish to open. </para>

    <para>As you might guess, to create a new database, choose
    &quot;Create a new database&quot;</para>

      <title>Selecting file</title>
      <para>
      If you're familiar with version 1.0.X of GRAMPS, you'll note
      that version 2.0 does not require you to select a directory in
      which to store the database.
