  sometimes strange output of Family Tree Maker.
* Better support for sources.  Source button on the main page, and
  sources are entered from the main screen, instead of being about 
  five layers deep.
* Events, sources, attributes, and addresses can now have both 
  sources and notes.
* Limited configurability in status bar display. Instead of just a
  name, you can have a name, the internal ID and a name, or a user
  selectable attribute and a name.
* A user selectable attribute can be displayed on the Edit Person
  display along with the gramps internal ID.  The attribute is
  specified in the preferences settings, and the value is taken
  from the person's attribute list.
* Images now load faster. Thumbnail images are created and maintained
  by gramps, eliminating the need to rescale images everytime a 
  gallery is displayed.
* Paper size preference can now be specified in the preferences 
  dialog. Once this is set, gramps will make this the default for
  report generators. Eventually, you will be able to do the same
  for output format preference. This button is current disabled.
* Generating slightly better XML. Maintaining compatibility with
  the older files.


Version 0.1.5

* Plenty of bug fixes in the report generators and merging due to the
  previous addition of date ranges.
* Added PDF file type generation for reports. Depends on the reportlab
  package (available at www.reportlab.com).  If the package is not
  installed, gramps will run, but without PDF generation ability.
* Will use the Python Imaging Library if present to handle images.  If
  not, it will revert to the old method of using Imagick (convert).
* The user can select an attribute (from the attribute list) to display
  on the Edit Person window.
* The internal gramps ID is now displayed on the Edit Person window.
* Marriage types can now be recorded.
* Addresses now use a single date instead of multiple dates, since 
  dates can now deal with ranges.
* Due to a bug in Python 2.0/GTK interaction, list colors are disabled
  for Python 2.0 and above.
* configure script now properly deals with Python include paths,
  eliminating the need to hand edit the src/Makefile to get gramps to
  run under Python 2.X.
* Photos are now displayed properly again in the Edit Person gallery.
* Family notes are now implemented.

Version 0.1.4

* Implemented date ranges.  Valid forms are "from <date> to <date>" and
  "between <date> and <date>".
* Better support for partial dates.  A question mark can optionally be 
  used for a placeholder for a year if the year is unknown.  Illegal 
  date formats issue a warning upon an attempt to save the date.
* Start of internationalization (i18n) support.  Had to include a single
  C file to allow libglade to understand translations.  This means that
  binary releases are no longer going to be platform independant.
* Start of a generic output formatter for report generation. Currently
  supports HTML, OpenOffice (625+), and AbiWord (0.7.13+).  Allows 
  control of paragraph and font styles.
* Added into CVS on sourceforge
* Fixed quite a few bugs

Version 0.1.3

* Allow the user to specifiy their preferred numerical date input format,
  either DD/MM/YY or MM/DD/YY on the preferences dialog box.
* Handles file problems a bit more gracefully.
* Use ISO-8859-1 character set instead of ASCII to support languages other
  than English.  Eventually this should go to unicode, but python 1.5.2
  does not have good unicode support.  Python 2.X/Gnome 2.X will be the 
  migration for this feature.
* Handle ANSEL encoding for import and exporting GEDCOM files.
* Fixed a bug in the selection of parents, which did not accept new parents
  if previous parents did not exist.

Version 0.1.2

* Allow the user the option to display alternate names in the person
  list. Alternate names in the list have an '*' appended to the end
  of the name.
* Merge function now gives the user the option of saving the name of
  the merged individual as an alternate name if the names are not 
  the same.
* Added the "Alternate Birth" and "Alternate Death" to the event list, 
  to allow other birthdates to be recorded. Gramps makes a distinction
  between the birthdate/deathdate and the alternates.
* GEDCOM import and export adapted to load/save alternate birth and
  death dates.  The first "BIRT" and "DEAT" tags are the ones used
  for the primary dates, the others are loaded as alternates.
* Added the ability to store web page addresses for each person. From
  the edit person page, the "Go" button brings up a web browser to
  display the page.
* Fixed a bug in the relationship calculator that caused a traceback
  when the person selected was a direct ancestor of the active person.
* Added the suffix field to the alternate name entry on the Edit Person
  form.
