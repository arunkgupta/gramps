Version 3.2.0 (beta1) -- the "I am your father" release.
* New Plugin System:
 -> In the Help Menu -> Menu Status, all available plugins are visible.  All
    plugins can be hidden, saving resources and hiding options you do not need.

    performance enormously.  New features are implemented as plugins that can
    be hidden.
 -> Performance improvement example:  Insertion of a new person in a family
    tree with 30000 people previously took 4 seconds on a 1.4GHz PC running
    Gramps 3.1, but now takes milliseconds.
* New Views:
 -> There are new views, and some existing views have been greatly improved
 -> People view can now be sorted on the columns
 -> A Place treeview is present, nicely grouping your places under country
    groups
 -> GeoView has left it's beta status behind and shows your data on an online
    map (OpenStreetMap or Google Maps, a fast internet connection is required)
 -> Help Menu -> Extra Reports/Tools open a webpage with downloadable views
* Other Improvements:
 -> Styled Notes now in most output formats that support styles
 -> New languages
 -> Select language in which report should be created (not yet available in
