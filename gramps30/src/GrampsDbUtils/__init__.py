"""
This package implements additions to the the GrampsDb database. 

This package should be used for code that extended GrampsDb but also 
depends on Gtk.

A number of importers and exporters are provided to convert between
the different backend formats.

To obtain a class that implements writers use the gramps_db_writer_factory
method and for readers use the gramps_db_reader_factory method. For information
on using these factories see the _GrampsDbUtilsFactories.py file comments.
