class FastFilterModel(gtk.GenericTreeModel):
    """A I{gtk.GenericTreeModel} that links to a BSDB cursor to provide
    fast access to large tables. This is a pure virtual class, it must be
    subclassed and the subclass must implement L{_get_table}, L{_get_cursor} and
    L{_get_object_class}.

    The primary trick is to use the path specification as the tree iter.
    This means that when the TreeView asks for the iter for path=[1,2]
    we just echo it straight back. The onlt hard part is making sure that
    on_iter_next can do something sensible. It needs to know how many
    non duplicate records are in the table and then it can just accept the
    iter from the TreeView and increment it until it reaches the total
    length.

    The record itself is only fetched when its value is requested from
    on_get_value() and when the number of childen need to calculated. The
    cursor looks after the number of children calculation but it does require
    walking the list of duplicate keys, usually this is quite short.
    
    @ivar _db: handle of the Gramps DB
    @ivar _table: main table to be displayed
    @ivar _cursor: cursor for accessing the table.
    @ivar _obj_class: the class of the object that is being pulled from
    the database. This should probably be one of the primary gen.lib
    classes.
    @ivar _num_children_cache: dictionary to hold the number of
    children for each primary record so that we don't have to look
    it up every time.
    @ivar _length: the number of primary (non duplicate) records.
