gramps for Debian
----------------------

This is the Debian package of GRAMPS.

If you do not install python-reportlab (gramps Recommends it be
installed) then you will be able to create usable PDF files only if
your database contains solely latin (iso-8859-1) characters. Reportlab
will generate PDF files containing non-latin characters although they
are quite large as the font must be included in the file.
