Please read the COPYING file first.
If building from source, also read the INSTALL file (at least through the
"SUPER-SHORT VERSION") before going further.

Requirements
--------------------------------
The following packages *MUST* be installed in order for Gramps to work:
   Python 2.5 or greater
   PyGTK2 2.10 or greater
   Python Glade bindings 
   librsvg2 (svg icon view)

The following packages are *STRONGLY RECOMMENDED* to be installed:
   GraphViz         Enable creation of graphs using GraphViz engine
                    http://www.graphviz.org
   xdg              Freedesktop utilities, eg xdg-open

The following packages are optional
   gtkspell         Enable spell checking in the notes
   ttf-freefont     More font support in the reports

No longer needed in 3.0:
   yelp             Gnome help browser. At the moment no help is shipped
                    with version 3.0.


Documentation
---------------------------------
The User Manual is now maintained on the gramps website,
http://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=User_manual
We might in the future distribute again a manual via gnome-doc-utils, this has not
been decided yet though.


Building on non-Linux systems: i18n support and GNU make
--------------------------------------------------------
If make fails, use gmake (the name FreeBSD gives to GNU make) instead.
You might need a patch also. FreeBSD has in ports a patch (  /usr/ports/science/gramps/files)
you need to apply to po/Makefile.in.in
