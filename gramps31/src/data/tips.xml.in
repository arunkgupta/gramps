<tips>

<_tip number="1">A range of dates can be given by using the format 
&quot;between January 4, 2000 and March 20, 2003&quot;
</_tip>

<_tip number="2">
In most cases double clicking on a name, source, place or media entry
will bring up a window to allow you to edit the object. Note that the
result can be dependent on context. For example, in the Family View
clicking on a parent or child will bring up the relationship editor.
</_tip>

<_tip number="3">An image can be added to any gallery or the Media View by dragging and
dropping it from a file manager or a web browser.
</_tip>

<_tip number="4">Birth order of children in a family can be set, even if they do not
have birth dates, by using drag and drop.
</_tip>

<_tip number="5">
<b>Talk to Relatives Before It Is Too Late</b>: 
Your oldest relatives can be your most important source of information.
They usually know things about the family that haven't been written down.
They might tell you nuggets about
people that may one day lead to a new avenue of research.
At the very least, you will get to hear some great stories.
Don't forget to record the conversations!
</_tip>

<_tip number="7">
<b>Filtering People</b>: In the People View, you can 'filter' individuals
based on many criteria. Go to the Filter (just to the right of the People
icon) and choose one of the dozen different presets. For example, all
adopted people in the family tree can be located. People without a birth
date mentioned can also be filtered. To get the results click Apply.
If the filter controls are not visible, enable them by choosing
<b>View &gt; Filter</b>.
</_tip>

<_tip number="8">
<b>Inverted Filtering</b>:
Filters can easily be reversed by using the 'invert' option.
For instance, by inverting the 'People with children' filter you can
select all people without children.
</_tip>

<_tip number="9">
<b>Locating People</b>: By default, each surname in the People View is
listed only once. By clicking on the arrow to the left of a name, the list
will expand to show all individuals with that last name.
</_tip>

<_tip number="10">
<b>The Family View</b>: The Family View is used to display a typical
family unit---the parents, spouses and children of an individual.
</_tip>

<_tip number="11">
<b>Shifting a Family View</b>: Changing the Active Person in the
Relationships View is easy. Just doubleclick on the name of a person
to make it the active one.
</_tip>

<_tip number="12">
<b>Who Was Born When</b>: The 'Compare individual events' tool allows you to
compare data of all (or some of) the individuals in your database. This is
useful, say, if you wish to list the birth dates of everyone in your
database.
</_tip>

<_tip number="13">
GRAMPS comes with a rich set of tools. These allow you to undertake
operations such as checking database for errors and consistency, as well as
research and analysis tools such as event comparison, finding duplicate
people, interactive descendant browser, and others.
All tools can be accessed through the <b>Tools</b> menu.
</_tip>

<_tip number="14">
<b>Calculating Relationships</b>: This tool, under <b>Tools &gt;
Utilities &gt; Relationship calculator</b> allows you to check if someone
else in the family is related (by blood, not marriage) to you. Precise
relationships as well as the common ancestors are reported.
</_tip>

<_tip number="15">
<b>SoundEx can help with family research</b>:
SoundEx solves a long standing problem in genealogy---how to handle
spelling variations. The SoundEx utility takes a surname and generates
a simplified form that is equivalent for similar sounding names.
Knowing the SoundEx Code for a surname is very
helpful for researching Census Data files (microfiche) at a library
or other research facility. To get the SoundEx codes for surnames in
your database, go to <b>Tools &gt; Utilities &gt; Generate SoundEx codes</b>.
</_tip>

<_tip number="16">

<b>GRAMPS Reports</b>: GRAMPS offers a wide variety of reports.
The Text Reports are particularly useful if you want to send
the results of your family tree to members of the family via email.
</_tip>

<_tip number="18">
<b>Starting a New Family Tree</b>: A good way to start a new family tree is
to enter all the members of the family into the database (use <b>Edit

<_tip number="20">
<b>Unsure of a Date?</b> If you're unsure about the date an event occurred
(for example birth or death), GRAMPS allows you to enter a wide
range of date formats based on a guess or an estimate. For instance,
&quot;about 1908&quot; is a valid entry for a birth date in GRAMPS.
See wiki manual of GRAMPS for a complete description of date entry options.
</_tip>

<_tip number="21">
<b>Duplicate Entries</b>: <b>Tools &gt; Database Processing &gt; Find
possible duplicate</b> people allows you to locate (and merge) entries
of the same person entered more than once in the database.
</_tip>

<_tip number="22">
The 'merge' function allows you to combine separately listed people into
one. This is very useful for combining two databases with overlapping
people, or combining erroneously entered differing names for one individual.
</_tip>

<_tip number="23">
To easily merge two people, select them both (a second person can be selected
by holding the Control key while clicking) and clicking on <b>Edit &gt; Fast
Merge</b>.

Back</b>.
</_tip>

<_tip number="25">
Tired of having to take your hand off the keyboard to use the mouse?
Many functions in GRAMPS have keyboard shortcuts. If one exists for a
function it is displayed on the right side of the menu.
</_tip>

<_tip number="26">
Don't forget to read the GRAMPS manual, <b>Help &gt; User Manual</b>.
The developers have worked hard to make most operations intuitive
but the manual is full of information that will make your time spent
on genealogy more productive.
</_tip>

<_tip number="27">
<b>Adding Children</b>: To add children in GRAMPS make either of the parents 
the Active Person then switch to the Family View. If the child is
already in the database, click on the third button down to the right
of the Children list. If the person is not already in the database,

After the child's information is entered they will automatically be
listed as a child of the Active Person.
</_tip>

<_tip number="28">
<b>Editing The Relationship of a Child</b>: Not all children are related by
birth to their parents. You can edit the relationship of a child to
each parent by making the child the active person. In the
Relationship View, click on the third icon to the right of the 
&quot;Parents:&quot; entry. This brings up the Family Editor. Now
select the child, right-click and choose &quot;Edit
relationship&quot;. Here you can set the relationship between the
child and its father and mother. Relationships can be any of Adopted,
Birth, Foster, None, Sponsored, Stepchild and Unknown.
</_tip>

<_tip number="29">
<b>Show All Checkbutton</b>: When adding a spouse or child, the
list of people shown is filtered to display only people who could

GRAMPS is wrong in making this choice, you can override that
filter by checking the &quot;Show All&quot; checkbutton.

GRAMPS users. This format has advantages over GEDCOM in that no
information is ever lost in exporting and importing.
</_tip>

directly to the GNOME file manager (Nautilus), for burning onto a CD.

GRAMPS helps you to keep personal information secure by allowing you to
mark information as private. Data marked as private can be excluded from
reports and data exports.
</_tip>

<_tip number="54">
Be accurate when recording genealogical information. Don't make assumptions
while recording primary information; write it exactly as you see it. Use
bracketed comments to indicate your additions, deletions or comments. Use of
the Latin 'sic' is recommended to confirm the accurate transcription of what
appears to be an error in a source.
</_tip>

<_tip number="55">
You can link any electronic media (including non-text information) and
other file types to your GRAMPS family tree.

<b>Good genealogy tip</b>: Information collected about your family is only as
good as the source it came from.
Take time and trouble to record all the
details of where the information came from. Whenever possible get a copy of 
original documents.
</_tip>

<_tip number="61">
Go from what you know to what you do not. Always record everything that is
known before making conjectures. Often the facts at hand suggest plenty of
direction for more research. Don't waste time looking through thousands of
records hoping for a trail when you have other unexplored leads.
</_tip>

<_tip number="62">
Genealogy isn't only about dates and names. It is about people. Be
descriptive. Include the <b>why</b> of how things happened, and how descendants
might have been shaped by the events they went through. Narratives go a long
way in making your family history come alive.
</_tip>

<_tip number="63">
